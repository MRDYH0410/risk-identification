John Edmunds, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Frank. Good afternoon everyone. After the close of the market today, we announced


Trident's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Before we begin, please note that during the


course of this conference call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements


regarding future sales of product, product transitions, market trends, future product shipments or


product introduction. Actual results may differ materially from these statements, subject to certain


risks and depending upon a number of factors included but not limited to, trends in the digital media


industry, Trident's ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner, Trident's ability


to win customer product design, pressures from competitors and pricing and our competitor's new


product introduction. For further information regarding our risk factors, please refer to our


registration statement in the most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and


Exchange Commission, accessible at www.sec.gov. I encourage you to read these documents.


To begin our review of the quarter, I would first like to briefly recap the financial results. We


reported net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 of 16.1 million, an increase of 5% in line with


our guidance of 5% to 10% from the 15.4 million recorded in September and a year-over-year


increase of 16.5% from the 13.8 million recorded in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.


Revenue from LCD and other advanced TVs was 10.4 million or 64% of revenue, which was up


sequentially 76% more than expected from the 5.9 million reported in December. Due to the


ramping of SVP-EX with our two existing tier-1 customers and up 117% from the 4.8 million


reported one year ago. In particular, revenue from LCD TVs more than doubled sequentially from


the 4 million recorded in December. Digital CRT projection business was 5.5 million or 36% of


revenue, which was down 39% sequentially. About half of which was, from expected seasonality


and half from inventory build up from sluggishness from Chinese New Year sell- through as well as


inventory product transition to the EX-11.


Net loss on GAAP basis in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, which includes charges for acquired in-


process research and development of 4,856,000 and non-cash amortization of deferred


compensation of 820,000 was a loss of 4.5 million or 19 cents per diluted share. This compares to


a net loss of 546,000 or 2 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and 2.4


million or 10 cents per diluted share in the same quarter one year ago. Pro forma net income in the

third quarter of fiscal year 2005 after excluding a charge for acquired in-process research and


development of 4.6 million and deferred compensation expense of 0.8 million was 0.9 million or 3


cents per diluted share. This compares to pro forma net income of 0.8 million or 3 cents per diluted


share in the prior quarter, which also excluded amortization of deferred compensation expense of


721,000 and loss on investment of 70,000 and 585,000 of acquired in-process research and


development.


And finally, the current quarter results compares to pro forma net income of 700,000 for the same


quarter of the prior fiscal year or 3 cents per diluted share which likewise excluded the 147,000 in


amortization of deferred comp and 1.9 million gain on sale of certain investment.


Gross margins for the quarter were 55.6 percent, essentially flat with 55.2% in the December


quarter. We continue to work on reducing our product cost with a continued moderate amount of


ASP erosion for the June quarter. We believe we can maintain overall gross margins flat with a


high-end of our business model target of 51 to 55% of our gross margin.


Pro forma operating expenses for the quarter totaled 7.7 million as expected an increase from the


7.6 million from the prior quarters due to expense management and a delay of one particular


product tape out. We expect operating expense to continue to increase by approximately $0.5


million for the next quarter, as we continue to invest in taping out our new products and adding field


resources to support new customers.


With regard to the tax provision, our taxes are fundamentally driven out of our operations in Taiwan,


will have an approximate 12.5% tax-rate. As we have operating losses from US operations that


cannot currently be benefited for tax and because we have in already interest charge which also


reduces our pre-tax income relative to the projected tax expense, our corporate wide consolidated


effective tax rate through the first nine months will end up to 25% resulting in a $420,000 charge for


tax expense in the March quarter. We expect roughly 350,000 in the June quarter, going forward


into fiscal '06, we hope to be able to continue to execute to an approximate 20% effective tax rate


or better.


Now turning to balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents excluding the UMC stock decreased by


4.6 million from 83 million to 78.4 million. This was due primarily from a $3 million decrease or 6%


adjustment to the valuation of the UMC stock. In addition, we used approximately 1.5 million in


cash from operation to support an expansion of receivables due to a change in mix of business to


our Japanese customers where we extend credit. We also received approximately 0.7 million as


proceeds from stock option exercises and used approximately 0.8 million of additional cash in the


acquisition of the minority interest. Capital expenditures were a 158,000 for the quarter. Accounts


receivable increased by 1.9 million from 2 million to 3.9 million. The ending AR balance is


equivalent to 22 days sales outstanding up from 12 days at the end of December. Total inventory


increased by 0.3 million from 2.5 million to 2.8 million or from 32 days to 36 days of inventory on


hand. Payables decreased by 0.9 million from the prior quarter due to the timing of payments


made during the quarter. Days payable outstanding decreased from 64 days at the end of


December to 58 days at the end of March, again, due to timing of payments made during the


quarter.


We also successfully closed the acquisition of minority interest on March 31st, issuing 1.9 million


shares and 2.9 million PMI option. Using the treasury stock method this will result in approximately


4.5 million additional share on share equivalent outstanding. But in turn, virtually eliminates the


need to record any potentially increasing charges for the minority interest of the digital television


business going forward. With our continued improvement and financial strength we intend to


continue our focus on resources and on growing our business. This concludes our financial review


for the quarter. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Frank for some business comments.
