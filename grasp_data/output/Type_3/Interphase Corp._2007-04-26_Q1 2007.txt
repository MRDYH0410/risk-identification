MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interphase First


Quarter 2007 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is


being recorded, Thursday, April 26th, 2007. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg


Kalush, CEO & President of Interphase, please go ahead, sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Demetrias, and good afternoon everybody, this is Greg Kalush. I’d to welcome you to


our first quarter 2007 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer,


who will begin our discussions with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter, then I’ll


conclude with some updates and recent business activity. We’ll conclude afterwards with a brief


Q&A. Tom?


Thomas Tipton, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating in for your interest in Interphase. Before


we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public. However,


some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business, financial


condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company could differ materially


from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Because of various risks and uncertainties


including without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of products, changes in


competition, economic condition, various inventory risks due to changes in market conditions, and


other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports. Although the foregoing risks and


uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in many cases the company


cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially and


as indicated by the forward-looking statements. So when used in this call the words “belief”, “plans”,


“expects”, “intends”, “anticipates”, and other similar expressions as they relate to the company or its


management are intended to identify forward-looking statements. I will now provide an overview of


our financial performance for the first quarter of 2007.


Revenues for the first quarter of 2007 were $5.1 million, representing a 37% decrease over


revenues for the first quarter of 2006 of 8.2 million. First quarter revenues were down approximately


37% when compared to fourth quarter revenues of 2006 of 8.1 million. The significant slowdown in


telecommunications spending including reduced demand from our top customers due to their


ongoing merger activity was the main contributor to this revenue decline.


Broadband telecom revenues declined approximately 28% to 4.2 million compared to 5.9 million in


the first quarter of 2006. As expected Slot Optimizer product line revenues declined to


approximately $375,000 compared to approximately 925,000 for the first quarter of 2006. All other


revenues decreased to approximately 500,000 compared to approximately 1.3 million for the first


quarter of 2006. Included in all of the revenues for the first quarter of 2006 was approximately


$400,000 of raw material parts sold at cost. There are no similar revenue generating inventory


transactions in the first quarter of 2007.


Gross margin for the first quarter of 2007 was 2.7 million or 53% compared to 4.1 million or 51% for


the first quarter of 2006. The increase in gross margin percentage for the quarter is primarily due to


two factors. First, the raw material part sale at cost that I just described, which brought product


margin down from the first quarter of 2006. And secondly, our reduction in excess and obsolete


inventory charges of $100,000 for the first quarter of 2007, when compared to the first quarter of


2006. These factors were partially offset by reduced factory utilization as product volumes


decreased compared to the first quarter of 2006.

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2007 were 4.9 million compared to 4.2 million for


the first quarter of 2006. The details of our operating expense trends are as follows. Research and


development expenses increased to 2.5 million for the first quarter of 2007, up from 1.9 million for


the first quarter of 2006. This increase is primarily due to continued investment in project related


research and development activity on a variable basis as we continue to prepare for several new


product introductions and a number of field trials scheduled for later this year.


Sales and marketing expenses increased slightly to 1.4 million for the first quarter of 2007 from 1.3


million for the first quarter of 2006. This slight increase was primarily driven by increased


investment and marketing activities to help position and expand product portfolios in the market.


General administrative expenses were essentially flat at $957,000. Our net loss for the first quarter


of 2007 was 1.9 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.30 compared to a net income of


$310,000, resulting in earnings per share of $0.05 for the first quarter of 2006.


Turning to the balance sheet, our working capital decreased to $25.3 million at March 31st, 2007


from $26.9 million at December 31st, 2006. Our cash and securities position decreased to $21.5


million at March 31st, 2007 compared to 22.5 million at December 31st, 2006. We will continue to


judiciously manage our working capital position as we believe that our balance sheet strength is an


important enabler for us to take full advantage of future growth and investment opportunities for our


business.


I’ll now turn it over to Greg, who will add some perspective to the significant events and


accomplishments during the quarter. Greg?


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned really, significant slowdown in the telecommunication


spending resulting from ongoing merger activity at our top customers resulted in fairly disappointing


financial performance this quarter. We are obviously disappointed with these results. We had


anticipated some slowdown of our revenue expectations for the first half due to merger activities but


we are somewhat hopeful that these impacts would not be too significant. Unfortunately, being a


book-to-bill business we were not sure how long orders would be stopped, but we realized in the


final few weeks in the quarter, the demand was going to be off in the quarter. The overall shipment


of products to our top 3 customers was off by more than 30% as compared to the same period last


year, and in one case shipments were off by more than 65%. The feedback from the market is that


many of the carriers delayed purchases from our customers pending the product line rationalization


from merger and integration activities, which in turn resulted in significant revenue slowdowns in the


first quarter, which obviously also impacted us.


As indicated in the earnings announcement of our largest customers, the market assumes some


slowdown in traditional wireless and core markets as a consequence, resulting reduced demand


has impacted our product line. I personally suspect that there has also been a slowdown resulting


from the integration of supply chain systems, install demand due to consolidation of inventories of


both telecom equipment manufacturers, as well as carriers in the first quarter.


Although we believe that much of the merger integration and planning activity is getting to be


behind us by now. We still wouldn’t be surprised to see continued lumpiness in our quarterly


revenues until customer demand stabilizes and they have the completed the communication of their


product roadmaps and their carrier customers. I will mention however that we are very encouraged


by the April overall load activity and expect a resumption of demand as was indicated by our


customer’s announcements.
