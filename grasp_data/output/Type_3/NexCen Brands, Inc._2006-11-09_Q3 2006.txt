MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to today’s NexCen Third Quarter 2006 Earnings Conference


Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Bass.


Please go ahead sir.


Steven Bass, Investor Relations


Thank you, Jocelyn, good afternoon everyone. On today’s call, we will discuss NexCen Brands


third quarter 2006 operating result along with NexCen’s recent acquisition of The Athlete's Foot.


Here with me today are Bob D'Loren, NexCen’s Chief Executive Officer and David Meister,


NexCen’s Chief Financial Officer and James Harren [ph] Brad NexCen’s Executive Vice President


of M&A.


Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call management may


make forward-looking statements that involve estimates, assumptions, expectations or projections.


We do want to caution you that actual results may differ materially from those included in any


forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties. For a description of risks


and uncertainties that may effect NexCen’s actual results and future performance we refer you to


the “Risk Factors” disclosure in our earnings release issued last evening and included as an exhibit


to the current report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC this morning as well as our 2005


Annual Report on Form 10-K. NexCen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking


statements made during this call.


With that I would like to turn the call over to David Meister. David?


David B. Meister, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you Steve and hello everyone. The financial results for the quarter ended September 30,


2006 include the impact of our acquisition of UCC capital that closed on June 6. The September 30,


2006 balance sheet includes line items related to the acquisition and the statement of operations


include operating activity for the entire quarter as well as the 24 days that we owned UCC in the


prior quarter.


First I will briefly review the balance sheet as of September 30. We had total cash and cash


equivalent and restricted cash as of September 30 of approximately $45 million which compares to


38 million as of June 30, 2006. The increase of approximately $7 million primarily relates to


principal repayments on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. I will be referring to the


mortgage-backed securities as MBS for the remainder of this call. The MBS balance measured at


fair market value was approximately $80 million as of September 30 which compares to 87 million


as of June 30. The decrease of approximately $7 million relates to the $7.7 million of principal


repayments received in the third quarter offset by market value unrealized gain of $555,000. As


previously reported the company sold its mortgage-backed securities on October 31, 2006 for


approximately 78 million. The sale was settled in the fourth quarter and we expect to report a gain


of approximately $743,000 on this sale. The combined total of cash and cash equivalents, restricted


cash and the value of the MBS portfolio at September 30 was approximately $125 million.


Now let’s move to the statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Net


interest income from our MBS portfolio was 1.3 million for the third quarter of ‘06 versus 1.3 million


for the second quarter of ‘06. Total operating expenses were approximately 2.6 million for the third


quarter, a decrease of about $260,000 as compared to the second quarter. This decrease was


primarily attributable to decreases of 709,000 in restructuring charges, 203,000 in share based

compensation and a net reduction of expenses relating to the company’s Baltimore office of


$48,000. These decreases were offset by an increase of $700,000 associated with having a full


quarter of UCC expense versus approximately $200,000 of UCC expenses that we had in the


second quarter.


Other items of note in the income statement for the quarter are the other income of 415,000


associated with payments received in connection with a venture capital investment that was written


off in 2002, a charge for share based compensation of $405,000 or one penny per share and loss


from discontinued operations of $333,000 also about one penny per share.


The net of all of this activity is a third quarter net loss of approximately 822,000 or $0.02 per share.


As I mentioned earlier with the sell of all of the company’s mortgage-backed in the fourth quarter of


2006 and the company’s exit from the MBS business the result of operations from the MBS


business will be included in discontinued operations in future period and the company’s continuing


operations will consist entirely of it's IT business. In accordance with GAAP NexCen will conform


prior period financial statement to reclassify MBS as discontinued operations so that all periods will


be presented on a comparable basis.


I will now discuss The Athlete’s Foot acquisition which as you know closed on Tuesday of this week


November 7. Under the terms of the transaction NexCen acquired the outstanding equity of The


Athlete’s Foot or $51.5 million of which 9.4 million was funded by issuing approximately 1.4 million


shares of NexCen common stock with the balance of the purchase price funded with the company’s


cash on hand.


Additionally there is a retention earn out of up to an additional 8.5 million payable on the same


combination of cash in stock if The Athlete’s Foot financial results for the year ending December


31, 2006 meets specified performance target.


I will now talk about some financials measures for The Athlete’s Foot. For the nine months ended


September 30, 2006, The Athlete’s Foot generated revenues of approximately $6.8 million for an


increase 3.8% over the same period of the prior year. For the full year of 2006, revenues are


expected to range from 9.6 million in 9.8 million an increase of 4% to 6% over the prior year. For


the full year 2007, revenues are expected to in a range from 10.7 million to 11.2 million an increase


of approximately 12 to 15% over 2006.


The Athlete’s Foot is expect to contribute incremental net revenue – net income, excuse me, to


NexCen of 3.8 million to $4 million or $0.08 per share for the full year of 2007, which makes this


transaction immediately accretive to our shareholders. The Athlete’s Foot is expecting to open


approximately 90 new stores in 2006 and 110 stores in 2007, which would bring the total store


count to approximately 700 by year-end 2007.


Total system-wide store sales is expected to be approximately 360 million for the full year of 2006,


an increase by approximately 11% to 400 million in 2007. Comp store sales for the six months


ended June 30, ‘06 which are based upon available information as recorded by The Athlete’s Foot


franchises are up 4.7% with domestic stores up 0.5% and international stores up 8.5%.


The Athlete’s Foot reports that average annual revenues for individual franchise stores operating at


lease 12 months are 860,000 and 450,000 for domestic and international locations, respectively.


The average store size is close to 2500 square foot for domestic store and about 1000 square feet


for an international store. New domestic stores are being opened and are targeted to be 2000


square feet in our new store design.


And with that I will turn the call over to Bob D’Loren.
