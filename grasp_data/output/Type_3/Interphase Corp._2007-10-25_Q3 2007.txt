MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the


Interphase Third Quarter 2007 Conference Results. During the presentation, all participants will be


in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator


Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday October 25th, 2007.


It is now my pleasure to introduce Greg Kalush, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, Sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. This is Greg Kalush, Chairman and CEO of Interphase


Corporation. I would like to welcome you all to our third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. With


me is Mr. Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin with a brief discussion and a


financial overview, and then I will conclude with some updates in recent business activity. Tom?


Thomas Tipton, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance


Thanks Greg. I would like to thank everybody for participating today, and for your interest in


Interphase. Before, we begin I would like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to


the public. However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our


business, financial condition, and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company


could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statement because of various


risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of


products, changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in


market conditions and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So, when used in


this call, the words “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” and other similar


expressions, as they relate to the company or its management are intended to identify forward-


looking statement.


I will now provide an overview of our financial performance to the third quarter and first nine months


of 2007. Revenues for the three months ended September 30th, 2007 were 8.4 million dollars,


representing a 9% increase over third quarter 2006 revenue up 7.8 million and a sequential


increase of approximately $200,000 over revenues for the second quarter of 2007.


The year-over-year increase in revenues was primarily driven by our broadband telecom revenues,


which rose approximately 14% to 7.2 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to 6.3 million for


the third quarter of 2006. Enterprise product line revenues decreased approximately $980,000 for


the third quarter of 2007, down from 1.3 million for the third quarter of 2006.


Revenues for the nine months ended September 30th, 2007, were 21.8 million, compared to 25.3


million for the first nine months of 2006. Broadband telecom revenues for the period decreased


approximately 9% compared to the previous year as a result of the significant reduction in revenues


experienced in the first quarter of 2007 due to the general telecommunications market slowdown,


as well as the M&A activity related slowdown experienced in the businesses of our top tier 1


customers.

Enterprise product revenues decreased to 2.4 million for the first nine months of 2007, compared to


3.8 million for the same period in 2006. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2007 was $5.2 million


or 61%, compared to 4.1 million or 52% for the third quarter of 2006.


The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by a shift in our product mix toward


higher margin products and more efficient operations. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue


was 59% for the nine months ended September 30th, 2007, compared to 54% for the same period


in 2006.


This increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September


30th, 2007, compared to the first nine months of 2006, is due to several factors. First, there was a


shift in our product mix in 2007 toward higher margin products. Second, in the first quarter of 2006,


we sold approximately $400,000 of excess inventory at cost, thus negatively impacting our 2006


gross margin.


And finally, our excess and obsolete inventory charges for the first nine months of 2007 were


approximately $100,000 less than compared to the same period in 2006. These factors were


partially offset by reduced factory utilization for the first nine months of 2007 compared to the same


period in 2006.


Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30th, 2007, were $5 million


compared to 4.1 million for the third quarter of 2006. The details of our operating expense trends


are as follows. Research and development expenses were 2.4 million for the third quarter of 2007,


up from two million for the third quarter of 2006. This increase is due to our continued investment


and project-related research and development activities, primarily on a variable basis, as we


continue to prepare for several new product introductions and a number of field trials scheduled for


later this year and next year.


Sales and marketing expenses increased to 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2007 from 1.2 million


for the third quarter of 2006. This increase is due to additional sales head count in Europe in 2007,


as we seek to expand our market reach on a global basis.


General and administrative expenses increased to 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2007 from


851,000 in the third quarter of 2006. This increase is primarily due to the utilization of outside


services associated with the company’s first-year management assessments for Sarbanes-Oxley


Section 404 compliance. And in addition, we incurred depreciation and support costs related to our


new enterprise management system that was recently installed in the second quarter of 2007.


Total operating expenses were 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30th, 2007,


compared to 13 million for the same period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to our continued


investment and project related research and development activity. We will continue to focus our


resources in the area of research and development, as we concentrate on delivering our new


AdvancedTCA and AdvancedMC products to our customers, and help them ensure a timely launch


of their product lines.


Net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $698,000 resulting in fully diluted earnings per share


of $0.10, compared to $175,000, or fully diluted earnings per share of $0.03, reported in the third


quarter of 2006. For the nine months ended September 30th, 2007 our net loss was $764,000,


resulting in a loss per share of $0.13. Our net income for the nine months ended September 30th,


2006 was 1.6 million resulting in earnings per fully diluted share of $0.27.


Turning to the balance sheet, our working capital improved to 26.6 million at September 30th, 2007,


an increase from 25.2 million at June 30th, 2007. Our cash and securities position improved slightly


during the quarter to 19.9 million at September 30th, 2007. We will continue to judiciously manage
