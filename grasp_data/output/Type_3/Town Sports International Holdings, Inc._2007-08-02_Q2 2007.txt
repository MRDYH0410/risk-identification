MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Town Sports International Second


Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob and I will be your coordinator for today.


At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer


session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions].


At this time I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Richard Pyle, Chief Financial


Officer. You may proceed.


Richard Pyle, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you and thank you for joining us today. This is the Town Sports International Holdings


earnings conference call discussing the second quarter of 2007. I am Richard Pyle, the Chief


Financial Officer of the company. I would caution listeners that to the extent we make any forward-


looking statements in this conference call they are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provision of


the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to various risks


and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, which may cause actual results to be


materially different from any forecasts we have made.


We have issued a press release discussing our results for the quarter, which has also been filed


with the SEC under a Form 8-K, as well as our 10-Q today. In addition for those of you who do not


have access to this release and filing, we have also made them available at our website,


www.mysportsclubs.com. This conference call is also being webcast and may be accessed via the


company’s Investor Relations section of our website. The replay and transcript of the call will be


available via the company’s website beginning after this call today.


I will now turn this call over to Bob Giardina, Chief Executive Officer of Town Sports International


for a discussion on the operations of the company and then I will give further detailed financial


discussions later in the call. Bob?


Robert Giardina, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Richard and good afternoon everyone. Once again, we are excited to be with you to


update you on our latest operating results, as well as update you on our company’s initiatives as we


move through 2007. First, I’m pleased to report we had a good second quarter and first half of the


year, which keeps us on track for achieving our guidance for 2007. We are also set to add another


11 clubs, for a total of 15 clubs or 10% unit growth this year and are already working on 2008 and


2009 units.


When compared to the prior quarter, our ancillary and non-membership revenues continued to build


as a percentage of total revenues, with our focus on personal training and other services helped to


drive that component of our business. We are also proud of our 5.7% comp store increase for the


quarter and believe we will maintain or improve on this rate in the second-half of the year. And


finally, our clustering strategy continues to pay dividends as we’ve added a new fitness-only club in


the second quarter in Rego Park, Queens, New York, which is off to a strong start.


Richard Pyle will give you the financial details on the second quarter in a moment, but I wanted to


point out the highlights. Revenues for the quarter were $119.8 million, an increase of 9.4% over the


prior year. Our comp store growth for clubs open at least 12 months for the year was strong at

5.7%. It was driven by member growth, ancillary revenue growth and price increases. It was a nice


improvement on top of very good results in last year’s second quarter.


Operating income grew by 20.8% to 16.4 million and EBITDA increased by 17% to 28.6 million or


just under 12% when adjusted for one-time items. And we believe that low double-digit is a good


target rate for growth for us to go along with our roughly 10% unit growth. We report net income for


the quarter of 6.4 million, which compares to a net loss of 2.7 million for Q2 of ‘06. Fully diluted


earnings per share were $0.24 compared to a loss of per share of $0.13 in Q2 of ‘06, which was


caused in part by a loss on extinguishment of the debt of $0.25 last year.


As of June 30th, 2007 we owned and operated 150 clubs and two partly owned clubs, 103 under


the New York Sports Club banner, with 39 in Manhattan, 21 Boston Sports Clubs, 18 Washington


Sports Clubs, 7 Philadelphia Sports Clubs, plus three clubs in Switzerland. As well as the club


opening referred to earlier, we shuttered a small club in DC at the end of its lease during the


quarter and successfully moved a majority of the member base to a newer Washington Sports


Clubs, which had been built in contemplation of this closure.


The company has signed 18 leases for 2007 and 2008 and is working on filling in the 2008 and


2009 pipelines at this point and our strategy will be continuing to focus on deploying our capital


where it’s likely to be most productive. We will continue to build both multi-recreational and fitness-


only format clubs within our 4 key markets by remaining flexible in our approach, both improving the


value proposition for our members and maximizing the economies of scale for TSI. I would now like


to pass the call over to Richard Pyle to cover more a detailed financial statement review. Richard?


Richard Pyle, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks very much, Bob. To focus on the second quarter’s results in particular, consolidated


revenue for the quarter was 119.8 million, an increase of 10.3 million or 9.4% for the quarter over


the prior year. The key driver of the growth was membership dues, which increased by 8.1% or 7.1


million. We experienced an improvement in total membership, excluding short-term summer


members, of approximately 8.4% compared to the prior year’s quarter end, which was


approximately in line with our club unit growth and our plan. Encouragingly, ancillary club revenue,


which includes personal training, our group exclusives and Sports Club for Kids programs, was up


2.6 million to 21.2 million or 14.2% when compared to the prior year.


Quarterly revenue at our same clubs and those clubs over 12 months old was ahead 5.7%, with


member growth of 2.9% being a key component. This was combined with the growth in ancillary


and other revenue at our comps contributing 2% and an overall average price increase of 0.8%. It


should be noted that for the quarter, approximately 75% of our revenue was collected electronically


in advance during the quarter by means of electronic funds transfer, which we believe is an


industry-leading statistic.


We have set out in our earnings release made available today an analysis of EBITDA for the


quarter. Our EBITDA, defined as set forth in our release, was 28.6 million, 4.2 million or 17% higher


than the second quarter of 2006. Our EBITDA margins were 23.9% compared to 22.3% in the prior


year. On the expense side it should, however, be noted that we experienced certain non-recurring


expenses in 2006’s second quarter, costs associated with a now aborted M&A activity totaling


about 1.1 million. This expense did not reoccur in 2007’s second quarter.


Depreciation expense came in at 11.7 million, which compares to 10.4 million in Q2 of ‘06 and as a


percentage of revenue 2007’s figure was 9.8% compared to 2006’s figure of 9.5. Total operating


expenses for the quarter grew to 103.4 million, an increase of 7.5 million or 7.8% from last year’s


second quarter.
