MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interphase First


Quarter 2010 Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.


Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder,


this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 22, 2010.


I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Kalush, CEO and President. Please go ahead,


sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Greg Kalush. I’d like to welcome you to


our first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our CFO, who will begin our


discussion with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter, and then I’ll provide some


recent updates on business activity. We’ll then conclude the call with a brief Q&A period. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company could differ


materially from these statements – and those indicated by the forward-looking statements, because


of various risks and uncertainties, including without limitation, changes in product demand, the


availability of products, changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to


changes in market conditions and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So when used in


this call, the words believes, plans, expects, intends, anticipates, and other similar expressions as


they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of 2010. Revenues for


the first quarter of 2010 were $3.8 million, compared to 8.4 million for the first quarter of 2009.


Revenues for the quarter were primarily impacted by broadband telecom revenues, which


decreased to 3.2 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to 8 million for the first quarter of


2009. Professional services revenues decreased to 160,000 for the first quarter of 2010, compared


to $249,000 for the first quarter of 2009.


Enterprise revenues increased to $217,000 for the first quarter of 2010, compared to 89,000 for the


first quarter of 2009. Gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2010 was 49%, compared to


60% for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to


reduced utilization of our manufacturing facility, and to a lesser degree a revenue mix shift toward


lower margin products.


Total operating expenses were $4.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2010, compared to


4.7 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2009. The details of our operating expense trends are


as follows. Research and development increased slightly to $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2010


from 2.0 million for the first quarter of 2009.

Sales and marketing expense decreased to 1.3 million for the first quarter of 2010 from 1.5 million


for the first quarter of 2009. This decrease is primarily due to reduction in commission and variable


compensation expense due to a decline in revenue.


General and administrative expense decreased to $1 million for the first quarter of 2010 from 1.2


million for the first quarter of 2009. This decrease is primarily due to decrease in the – our funding


at potential variable compensation during 2010 compared to 2009 due to reduced revenues.


Our net loss for the first quarter of 2010 was $2.4 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.34,


compared to a net income of $707,000, resulting in an income per fully diluted share of $0.11 for


the first quarter of 2009.


Turning to the balance sheet, our working capital position decreased approximately $2.2 million


during the quarter to 19 million. Our cash and securities position decreased during the quarter to


15.9 million at March 31, 2010. As always, we will continue to carefully manage our working capital


and cash and securities position as our balance sheet strength is a key enabler for us to take full


advantage of our future growth and investment opportunities of our business.


I’ll now turn it back over to Greg, who will add some perspective to the significant events and


accomplishments within our business, Greg?


Gregory B. Kalush, President, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Tom. And again, welcome everyone. The telecom equipment demand picture for the


first quarter of 2010 remains very difficult to predict. First quarter results speak to the nature of the


problem we’ve seen unfold. The Tier 1 TEMs are losing market share to Asian equipment providers


in the China market and are struggling to come back at lesser price points propagated by these


providers.


It is clear that the Asian equipment providers are heavily leaning upon their low cost infrastructures


as competitive weapons and with the help of the Asian government, who favor local providers, have


seen significant market share shifts over the past several quarters.


As I mentioned in our last call, it does appear prudent to assume that Tier 1 customers will reverse


the market share trend in the emerging countries anytime soon. Therefore, as I mentioned in our


last call, in the first quarter of 2010, Interphase embarked upon a multi-tiered strategy to diversify


itself into a number of new business opportunities and also diversify its customer base for existing


products and services.


Over the last quarter, we made good progress during the introduction of contract manufacturing


services into Interphase’s portfolio of service offerings. In March, we hired a dedicated sales person


with over 20 years experience in selling contract manufacturing services and products to customers


that have manufacturing environments that closely fit our capabilities and our processes.


Additionally, our component suppliers have demonstrated a strong desire to work with us to


promote our contract manufacturing services, since they know it will directly benefit them through


additional local component sales. Since our processes and procedures have been formed over


many years to ensure we consistently provide the highest level of quality, reliability and on-time


delivery, we are confident that we will provide a superior experience to our contract manufacturing


customers.


We’ve also begun to target new opportunities in Engineering Design Services, which now – is now


off and running. We are currently working 15 new Engineering Design Services opportunities that


are either in the proposal negotiation or final agreement stage. And a number of these
