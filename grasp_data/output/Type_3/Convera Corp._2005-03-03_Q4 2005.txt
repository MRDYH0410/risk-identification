fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 totaled 6.3 million, a 6% increase from the comparable period of fiscal


2004. A large contract award from a government agency engaged in national security, as well as


the $750,000 sales of the Associated Press drove the quarter’s revenue performance. On a


sequential basis, revenues increased by 3 percent. Revenues from the federal sector represent a


39% of reported fourth quarter results, which mirrored the year-ago quarter. Commercial activities


contributed 37% to the quarter’s revenue, this compares to 35% for the prior year period; our

aforementioned Associated Press contract did represent more than 10% of the reported revenue


for the fourth quarter.


Turning to expenses. Total expenses for our fourth quarter were 9.9 million, inclusive of


approximately $400,000 in net restructuring charges incurred in December 2004. This compares to


12.1 million in total expenses for the prior year quarter. Cost of revenues totaled 1.1 million for the


period, representing a 45% decrease from the year ago quarter. Reduced personnel cost and


improved third party royalty practices were the primary cause of this expense improvement.


Resulting gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was 83 percent, this compares to a


gross margin of 67% for the same period of fiscal 2004. Operating expenses for the period were


8.8 million, representing a 13% improvement when compared to the 10.1 million, as reported for the


prior year period. Sales and marketing cost decreased by 49% when measured against the year


ago quarter, while research and development expenses increased by 35% over the fourth quarter


of last year, future growing personnel and operating cost associated with our web initiative. G&A


expenses decreased by 15% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.


The net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 improved to 3.5 million or 9 cents per share. This


compares to a net loss of 3.7 million, or 11 cents per share for the comparable year ago quarter.


Now turning to our fiscal 2005 results, consolidated revenues for the 12-month period, ended


January 31, 2005, totaled 25.7 million, a decrease of 12% when compared to consolidated


revenues of 29.3 million, as reported for fiscal 2004. The year-over-year revenue decline is


primarily attributable to a $2.4 million federal enterprise license transaction realized during the prior


year, in the absence of a life size deal in fiscal 2005.


From a mix perspective, our federal business accounted for 45% of fiscal 2005 revenue, while


commercial contributed 26 percent, and international 29 percent. This compares to 52 percent,


24% and 24% respectively for fiscal 2004.


Now to expenses. Total expenses for fiscal 2005 were 45.7 million, representing an 8%


improvement from the 49.9 million as reported for fiscal 2004. Cost of revenues for fiscal 2005


totaled 6.7 million or 22% less than fiscal 2004. As a result, our gross margin increased to 74


percent, up from 71% as reported in the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses for the 12-month


period ended January 31, 2005 were 39 million, this compares to 41.3 million for the comparable


12-month period of the prior year. For fiscal 2005, sales and marketing cost decreased by 20%


when compared to fiscal 2004, R&D expenses increased by 15 percent, while G&A cost decreased


by 8% on a year-over-year basis. For the 12-month ended January 31, 2005, the company


recorded a net loss of 19.8 million or 56 cents per share compared to a net loss of 18.1 million or


57 cents per share for the same period last year.


We included the year with 17.8 million in cash and investments, and although the components of


our balance sheet are aligned with the prior year period, exclusive of increases in property, plant,


and equipment resulting from our build out of the AT&T hosting facility for our web initiative.


In closing, while the expense reductions that we effected during the latter half of fiscal 2005 were


difficult, they were a necessary action to comply with our going forward strategy and have, to date,


proven to be correct [indiscernible] are removing approximately 22 million from our expense base,


realigning our sales and operating functions towards the emerging government sector. We are of


the belief that at historical run rates on revenue, our core software products business will be net


income neutral for fiscal 2006. We will however, continue to invest in our web indexing initiative


such that on a consolidated basis, we will remain in a net loss position until such time as the web


indexing system is brought to the commercial marketplace and revenues are realized. We will also


continue to prudently manage our cash in a manner consistent with our operating objectives, while


also assessing the capital markets relative to our future capital requirements primarily for the web


indexing offering.
