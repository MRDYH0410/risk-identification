MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interphase third


quarter 2006 results conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only


mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At that time, if you have a


question please press the one followed by the four on your telephone. If at any time during the


conference you need to reach an operator, please press star zero. As a reminder, this conference


is being recorded today, Thursday, October 26, 2006. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr.


Greg Kalush. Please go ahead, sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon everyone. This is Greg Kalush, CEO and President of Interphase


Corporation. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2006 earnings conference call.


With me is Mr. Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin our discussion with an


overview of our financial performance for the quarter, and then I'll conclude with some updates and


recent business activity. Tom?


Thomas Tipton, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I'd like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition, and prospects of the company. The actual results for the company could differ


materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and


uncertainties including, without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of products,


changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in market


conditions, and other risk indicated in the company's SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So when used in


this call, the words believes, plans, expects, intends, anticipates, and other similar expressions as


they relate to the Company or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


I'll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months


of 2006. Revenues for the three months ended September 30
 
th


, 2006, were 7.8 million,


representing a 12% increase over revenues for the third quarter of 2005, which were 6.9 million.


Third quarter revenues are 17% lower than second quarter 2006 revenues of $9.4 million due to an


unexpected 66% reduction in product demand for this quarter from a major US-based


telecommunications customer. Had our third quarter revenues from this customer been flat


compared to last quarter, our total company revenues would have been just above $10 million this


quarter.


Product demand from other customers remained strong, as revenues from three of our four largest


customers increased during the third quarter of 2006 when compared to the second quarter of


2006. The only product demand decrease in this group came from the US-based


telecommunications customer I discussed earlier.


The increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2006, compared to the third quarter of 2005, was


primarily driven by substantial increase in broadband telecom revenues, which rose approximately

39% to $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $4.5 million for the third quarter of


2005. As expected, Slot Optimizer product line revenues declined to $1.1 million for the third


quarter of 2006, compared to $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2005.


Revenues for the nine months ended September 30
 
th


, 2006, were 25.3 million, an increase of


approximately 9% on a year-to-date basis, compared to 23.3 million for the nine months ended


September 30, 2005. Once again, the primary driver of the revenue growth is broadband telecom


revenues, which increased approximately 29% to 19.9 million for the nine months ended


September 30
 
th


, 2006, from 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005. Again, as


expected, Slot Optimizer product revenues decreased to 3.3 million for the first nine months of


2006, compared to 5.6 million for the first nine months of 2005.


Gross margin for the third quarter of 2006 was $4.1 million, or 52%, compared to $3.5 million, or


50%, for the third quarter of 2005. The increase in gross margin percentage is primarily driven by a


reduction in inventory obsolescence charges. We conduct an analysis each quarter, as we examine


our inventory for impairment, and as a result of the analysis this quarter, we recorded a charge of


$100,000, compared to our obsolete charges of $200,000 for the second quarter of 2005.


Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 54% for the first nine months of 2006, compared to


53% for the first nine months of 2005. The increase in gross margin percentage was, again,


primarily driven by a reduction in inventory obsolescence charges. We recorded a charge of


$400,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, compared to a charge of $600,000 for


the same period in 2005.


Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2006, were $4.1 million,


compared to $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2005. The details of our operating expense trends


are as follows. Research and development expenses were $2 million for the third quarter of 2006,


up slightly from $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2005. This increase is due to our continued


investment in project-related research and development activities, albeit on a variable basis.


Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2006 from $1.7


million for the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the


Company's restructuring plans initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005. General and administrative


expenses were relatively flat at $851, 000. Total operating expenses decreased to $13 million for


the nine months ended September 30, 2006, compared to $13.6 million for the same period in


2005. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of the cost savings generated by the company's


restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005, partially offset by some strategic


reinvestment in research and development activity and potential variable compensation awards that


have been accrued for during the nine month period, as the company's performance has improved


compared to the prior year.


Our net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $175,000, resulting in earnings per share of $0.03,


compared to a net loss of $912,000, or a loss per share of $0.15, for the third quarter of 2005. Our


net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, was $1.6 million, resulting in earnings


per share of $0.27, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or a loss per share of $0.21, for the


same period in 2005.


Turning to the balance sheet, our working capital improved to $26.7 million at December 31, 2006,


an improvement of $2.1 million compared to December 31, 2005. Our cash and securities position


improved approximately $3.3 million from our 2005 year-end and now sits at $21.8 million, a


historical high. We continue to judiciously manage our working capital position, as we believe that


our balance sheet strength is an important enabler for us to take full advantage of our future growth


and investment opportunities for our business.
