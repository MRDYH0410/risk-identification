I would now like to turn your presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Rajiv Mathur,

Rajiv Mathur, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Lacy. Good afternoon and welcome to this webcast. Whether it is a poor global


economic situation or poor economic situation in our country, whether it was a bad time for our


customers to launch a new product line or our customers could not go to market with full financial


backing due to bad times. Whether our customers did not receive repeat orders from end-users or


our customers lost some key accounts, the bottom line is that we suffered.


However, we did move forward in adding new customers and continued with our pharmaceutical


product development plan. And that is what is going to secure and brighten our future growth. To


alleviate the economic dependence of the consumer business, our efforts doing pharmaceutical


business are showing results. We have secured orders for approximately $0.5 million to deliver four


prescription commercial products during the fourth quarter this year. Besides this, we have already


received product and process development fees for these products. To honor our customers’


request, we are not at the liberty of disclosing their names or the product we are going to be


manufacturing for them until the products are launched later this year.


Each of our customers is a significant customer for us no matter how small or large their operations


may be. In our own planned product development efforts, we have initiated complete stability


studies on three of the five pharmaceutical products. We expect to initiate Phase I clinical studies


on these as soon as stability is completed, subject to authorizing necessary capital to continue with


such work.

We have executed several product development agreements in the cosmeceutical and OTC


pharma area and have recently initiated development work on them. Typically, these products


require six to eight months for completion, with possible commercialization a few months thereafter.


We are also in negotiation with several pharmaceutical companies to develop prescription products.


Once executed, these require up to 18 months of formulation development, followed by required


clinical testing and regulatory approval.


As we move towards pharma products, in the last four or five months we have made some capital


improvements to our manufacturing area and added equipment in our analytical and manufacturing.


The improvements, however, were limited by the available cash. We are also preparing ourselves


for additional pharma development work and have hired more experienced analytical and


formulation development scientists. Also to improve our operations, we have restructured our


finance, purchasing, customer service and warehouse functions. We continue to seek


pharmaceutical business partners, improvements in our manufacturing area and experienced


people to strengthen our team.


Now, I have both Nadya Lawrence (Vice President Operations) and Carlene Lloyd (Vice President


Finance) from our management team and now we’ll be ready to entertain any questions you may


have.
