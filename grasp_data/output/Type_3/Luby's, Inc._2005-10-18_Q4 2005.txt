…effective labor deployment. Other operating expenses were 18.6% of sales in the fourth quarter


of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. General and Administrative costs were 7.1% of sales in the fourth


quarter of 2005 compared to 6.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. This increase was


driven by increased professional fees relating to Sarbanes-Oxley and the implementation of new


business systems.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we've reclassified store management compensation from "other


operating expenses" to "payroll and related costs" to provide comparability to financial results


reported by our peers in the industry. These amounts were $11.1 million and $9.7 million for fourth


quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively. For the years, the amounts were $33.7 million and


$30.8 million for the fiscal years ended 2005 and 2004 respectively.


Income from continuing operations in the 17 week fourth quarter fiscal 2005 was were $9.4 million,


an increase of 192.9% compared to $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. EBITDA in the


17 week quarter and – quarter of fiscal 2005 was $13.6 million, an increase of 52.3 million –


percent, excuse me, – compared to EBITDA of $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.


Fiscal 2005 sales were $322.2 million, an increase of 8.2% compared to $297.8 million in fiscal


2004. Excluding the additional week in 2005, same-store sales growth was 6.1 million – was 6.1%.


All of the Company's same-store – all the Company stores were characterized, as same-store


sales. Net income in fiscal 2005 was $3.4 million, or 15 cents per share fully diluted, compared to a


loss of $6 million, or 26 cents per share fully diluted, in fiscal 2004.


Income from continuing operations in the 53 week fiscal year 2005 was $19.8 million, an increase


of a 139.8% compared to 8.2 million in fiscal 2004. EBITDA in the 53-week fiscal year 2005 was


$34.8 million an increase of 31.7% compared to an EBITDA of 26.4 million in fiscal 2004.


Moving on to the balance sheet, in the fourth quarter we reduced our outstanding debt by 16.3


million to 13.5 million, as of August 31, 2005. We established a new three-year unsecured


revolving credit facility in the amount of $45 million with a capacity to expand up to $60 million,


which replaced our prior $50 million secured revolving letter of – our line of credit.


We ended the fiscal year with $4.4 million in cash and short-term investments compared to $5.6


million at the end of the last fiscal year. As of August 31 2005, the company had a total of $9.3


million in property held for sale. During the fourth quarter we sell two closed stores in new


Brownsville and Paris Texas.


In summary, from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the company’s progress in


generating cash, reducing debt and maximizing profitability. I will now turn the call back over to


Chris.

Christopher Pappas, Chief Executive Officer and President, Director


Thanks Erne. Same-store sales growth for the seventh quarter in a row is evidence of stronger


operations exciting new products, and a targeted advertising message contributing to sales growth.


We were also able to maintain lower cost as a percentage of sales. Despite the recent hurricane


activity, which I'll discuss later in more detail, we experienced great weather throughout our markets


and unseasonably low amounts of rainfall during the summer months.


From an operations standpoint, we continue to introduce new menu items and provide our


customers with a variety of excellent choices. We run new promotions every three months to


highlight different times of the year and emphasis select messaging to our customers.


And our back to school promotion, which ran from July 10th to September 25th we introduce two


new menu items a Spicy Monterrey Chicken and Sweet Sesame Pork dish. Both of which were big


hits with our customers. We find that because our customers tempted keep with us at a very high


frequency and that providing them with new selections on regular basis is a welcome change.


On October 3rd, we began our fall promotion, which will run through January 1st. We introduced


two new items; Southwest Chicken Breast and the Grilled Mesquite Salmon and we launched our


new TV commercials. Our new ads feature a young family on the run healing with a tampered


strength of work, school and ballet practice are still meeting to fit in a good healthy meal at


reasonable price. This is a market in which we believe Luby's really excels. In Luby's we offer our


customers convenience with our cafeteria stall, quality with our made from scratch menu, variety


with our 14 combination meal choices and savings with our value pricing.


From a capital expenditure perspective, we will continue to invest in our stores. This past year we


made a great deal of progress investing in the back of the house, which is our kitchen, improving


and updating our kitchens. And in fiscal 2006 we’ll focus on our serving lines and dining rooms.


We will continue to upgrade at a number of our stores with new table and new chairs, backup


upgrades and carpet and paint work. We will also continue to focus on our brand and improving


our guest dining experience.


Finally, through ongoing training and development, we are cultivating a strong team of restaurant


managers and leaders. Our people are our most valuable assets and our success ultimately


depends on them. While Ernie has already reviewed our costs, let me note that while food


commodities during the quarter were up slightly compared to last year, we watch these markets


very closely and make purchases that help reduce our risk. We will continue to monitor these and


other costs very closely and look for opportunities to operate more efficiently. As we are all familiar,


utility costs are on the rise, where possible we lock in rates in deregulated markets.


During the fourth quarter, we were locked in to favorable electricity rates in the Houston and Dallas


markets since 2004. However, our locked in rates hovered 2006 are close to double what they


were in those markets for the next year. Unfortunately it’s difficult to lock in your gas prices, which


have recently spiked. We project that our utility cost as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2006 will


range from 5.7 to 5.9% of sales compared to 4.2% of sales in fiscal 2005. With the rise of oil and


gas prices, it’s difficult to gauge what the impact will be on the casual dining in Luby’s specifically.


Our feeling is that we are operate in a very mix segment with virtually no other restaurant


companies in our markets doing exactly what we did which is providing the quality food and service


in a convenient delivery message with value price. In our opinion this might – a compelling case to


the customer to choose our restaurants over the more expensive dining restaurants and above the


quality and variety of quick service restaurants.


I’d like to provide you with an update regarding the impact of Hurricane Rita. As the storm


approach the Texas coast we began closing the units in the designated coastal evacuation zones.


Closer to the time of landfall more stores were closed at the Houston area shutdown advise for the
