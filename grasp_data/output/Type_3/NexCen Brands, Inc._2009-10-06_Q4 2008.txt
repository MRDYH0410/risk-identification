MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Kenneth J. Hall, Chief Executive Officer


We are pleased to have completed another step in becoming current with our financial reporting


obligations. Our SEC filings have taken longer than we anticipated because of certain open income


tax items, but we have addressed these items and are moving closer to reporting compliance.


At the same time, we have been implementing our turnaround strategy in order to strengthen our


business, corporate infrastructure, and financial condition. We are pleased with the progress we


have made in a relatively short period of time, and believe our efforts are reflected in the company’s


encouraging first quarter 2009 financial results.


In our press release, we’ve provided the company’s adjusted financial data on a rolling five-quarter


basis from the first quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009 to aid our investors in


understanding the events of 2008, our immediate actions to address those events and their impact


on our financial results.


In looking back at those five quarters, I’m pleased that on a year-over-year basis and sequential


quarterly basis, our performance is improving despite the challenging economic environment.


In the first quarter of 2009, we grew revenues by 17% compared to the same period last year, and


reduced operating expenses by 21%, or $2.6 million. We also improved our operating and bottom


line results. We generated $1.8 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2009, compared to


an operating loss of $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. And for the first time in 12 quarters, yes,


that’s three years, the company generated cash flow from its continuing operations. These results


are reflective of our efforts over the past year to streamline our business, reduce operating


expenses, and strengthen our franchise brands.


Importantly, we have improved our EBITDA and operating cash flows dramatically compared to


2008, and we anticipate further improvements in these key metrics as we move forward. We also


reduced our debt and placed the company on stronger financial footing. Specifically, in the last 10


months, we reduced debt by $43 million through the sale of Waverly and Bill Blass in 2008, as well


as from the recent TAF license agreement. Further, we have experienced significant reductions in


interest expense.


Nonetheless, we continue to seek additional opportunities that will enable us to grow our revenues,


further de-lever our balance sheet, and further reduce expenses. In other words, while we are


encouraged by these results, we recognize and believe that there is room for continued


improvement.


As for 2008, there is no question that our results were adversely affected by a number of


challenges, both specific to our company and to the broader economy. Second and third quarter


2008 results were particularly impacted by material expense items related to our amended 2007


filing, restructuring of our debt, and the strategic repositioning of the company.


Now I’d like to turn the call over to Mark to go over these results in more detail. Mark?


Mark E. Stanko, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Ken. I will briefly discuss our financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and the


year ended December 31, 2008. Please note that the results for each respective period are


described more fully in the Form 10-Q and 10-K, which we filed today. Total revenues for the first

quarter of 2009 increased 17% to 11.9 million compared to 10.2 million in the first quarter of 2008.


This increase is attributable to the fact that we’re not quite comparing apples-to-apples.


We acquired Great American Cookies in January of 2008, so we only owned that brand for two


months in the first quarter of 2008. On a pro-forma basis, assuming that we had owned Great


American Cookies for the full three months in the first quarter of 2008, our revenues year-over-year


have declined by 3%. Nonetheless, in light of the dramatic change in the economy from the first


quarter 2008 to first quarter 2009, we are heartened that our revenues have been relatively resilient


in the downturn.


Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2009 declined 21%, 10.1 million, compared to 12.8


million in the first quarter of 2008.


As a result of our increased revenues and decreased expenses, we realized operating income of


$1.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to operating loss of 2.6 million in the first quarter


of 2008. Loss from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2009 was $700,000, or $0.02 per


fully diluted share, improved from a net loss from continuing operations, in the first quarter of 2008


of $6.4 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share. These operating results exclude businesses that


were discontinued during 2008.


Turning to our cash position, as of March 31, 2009, the company had total cash of approximately


$8.3 million, including short-term restricted cash. That compared to total cash of approximately $8.3


million at December 31, 2008 and $20.7 million at March 31, 2008.


Importantly, we are cash flow positive from operations in first quarter of 2009. As you can imagine,


becoming and maintaining positive cash flow is a key goal for the company. Net cash provided by


operating activities was $400,000 for our three months ended March 31, 2009 compared to net


cash used in operating activities of 2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and


net cash used in operating activities of 4.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008.


Now, I’m going to repeat these numbers because we’re proud of them. NexCen consumed $4.4


million of cash in the first quarter of 2008 and we generated $400,000 in the first quarter of 2009.


That’s an approximate $5 million improvement in just four quarters. Cash flow is the metric that we


keep very close watch over. We anticipate that cash generated from operations will provide us with


sufficient liquidity to meet the expenses related to ordinary course operations, including debt


service obligations for at least the next 12 months.


However, we remain cautious about our financial condition and liquidity, and we disclose in our


financial reports that there remains uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going


concern. Given the current economic environment and the constraints of our credit facility, we are


not yet in a position to completely dispel this uncertainty. Please refer to our SEC filings for


additional details on this point.


Looking at our balance sheet, at March 31, 2009, our outstanding debt balance was approximately


142.5 million compared to 178.7 million at March 31, 2008 and 142.3 million at December 31, 2008.


As discussed in great detail in our filings, we reduced our outstanding debt balance by $33.4 million


in the fourth quarter of 2008 after we sold our Blass and Waverly brands. More recently, we further


reduced our outstanding debt by $5 million in August 2009, using a portion of the net proceeds from


the grant of a long-term exclusive licenses for the TAF brand in Australia and New Zealand.


Now turning to 2008, as Ken stated, our results last year were materially impacted by particular


events and circumstances that we faced. As a result, year-over-year comparisons between 2008


and 2007 are not meaningful because of the unusual events of 2008 and because the company did


not own many of its brands for a full year 2007.
