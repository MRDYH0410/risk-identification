MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interphase second


quarter 2009 results conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only


mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. As a


reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 23, 2009.


I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Kalush, President and CEO of Interphase.


Please go ahead, sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Greg Kalush. I’d like to welcome you to our


second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer


who will begin our discussion with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter and I’ll


conclude with some updates on recent business activity. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections for the public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition and prospects of the company.


The actual results of the company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-


looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, changes


in product demand, the availability of products, changes in competition, economic conditions,


various inventory risks due to changes in market conditions, and other risks indicated in the


company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.


So, when used in this call, the words believes, plans, expects, intends, anticipates and other similar


expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify forward-


looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter and first six months


of 2009. Revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were $8.1 million, representing a 22% increase


over revenues from the second quarter of 2008 of $6.7 million.


Revenues for the quarter were primarily driven by broadband telecom revenues, which increased


approximately 17% to 7.2 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 6.2 million for the


second quarter of 2008.


Our Professional Services revenues increased to $257,000 compared to 21,000 on a year-to-year


basis. Additionally, enterprise product line revenues increased to $345,000 for the second quarter


of 2009, compared to $196,000 for the second quarter of 2008.


Revenues for the first six months of 2009 increased approximately 17% to 16.5 million, compared


to 14.1 million for the first six months of 2008. Broadband telecom revenues increased

approximately 27% to 15.2 million for the first half of 2009 from 12 million for the same period in


2008.


Professional Services revenues increased to $506,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2009


from 138,000 for the same period in 2008. Enterprise product line revenues decreased to $434,000


for the first six months of 2009, compared to 629,000 for the first six months of 2008.


Gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, for the second quarter of 2009 was 55%, compared to


47% for the second quarter of 2008. The increase in gross margin, as a percentage of revenues,


was primarily driven by a revenue mix shift toward higher-margin products and increased utilization


of our manufacturing facility.


On a year-to-date basis, gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 57% for the first six


months of 2009, compared to 53% for the first six months of 2008. The increase in gross margin is


primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix toward higher-margin products, as well as


increased utilization of our manufacturing facility. These two factors were partially offset by the


margin implication of a $973,000 project cancellation fees that we received in the first quarter of


2008, which had no cost of sales associated with it and therefore provided the company 100%


margin. Additionally, we recorded $100,000 more in excess and obsolete inventory charges during


the first half of 2009, when compared to the first half of 2008.


Total operating expenses were 4.7 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared to 4.9 million


for the second quarter of 2008. The details of our operating expense trends are as follows:


Research and development expense decreased to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2009,


down from 2.5 million for the second quarter of 2008.


This decrease is due to three factors. First, there is a reduction in project-related research and


development expenses of approximately $225,000 year-to-year. Second, much of our research and


development resources are located in France and as such, those costs are subject to exchange


rate fluctuations with the euro and the dollar. The dollar was significantly stronger against the euro


in the second quarter of 2009, compared to the second quarter of 2008. This exchange rate


fluctuation resulted in a decrease to R&D expense of approximately $160,000 year-over-year.


And finally, included in research and development expenses in the second quarter of 2008 was a


charge of approximately $115,000 related to software that was originally procured for the


development of a product that was subsequently discontinued. There was no such charge in the


second quarter of 2009.


Sales and marketing expense increased to $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2009, from 1.2


million for the second quarter of 2008. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily


driven by increased head count and business development, product management and marketing,


as well as increased variable compensation expense, including commissions, as revenues for the


quarter increased 22% year-over-year.


General and administrative expenses were flat at $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2009,


compared to the second quarter of 2008. On a year-to-date basis, total operating expenses were


$9.3 million for the first six months of 2009, compared to 10.5 million for the first six months of


2008. This decrease is due to four main factors. First, the reduced head count and facility expense


resulting from the restructuring plan we undertook in the first quarter of 2008 decreased operating


expenses by approximately $500,000 for the first half of 2009, compared to the same period in


2008.


Second, project-related research and development expenses decreased by approximately


$450,000 for the first six months of 2009, compared to the first six months of 2008. Third, operating
