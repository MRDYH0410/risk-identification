& Controller, GTT Communications, Inc.


Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined today by Rick Calder, GTT's President and CEO; Eric Swank, GTT's


Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Thompson, GTT's Executive Chairman of the Board. Our discussion this


morning is being made available via webcast through our website. A replay of this call will be available for one


month. Dial-in information for the replay as well as access to a replay of the webcast is available on our website at


www.gt-t.net.


I would also like to mention that our comments today will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning


of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon


or refer to future events or conditions or that involve the use of words such as anticipate, expects, intents, plans,


believes, may, will, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


Forward-looking statements included, by way of example, revenue and margin expectations or projections and


various references to trends in the industry and GTT's business. Such statements reflect our current views with


respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some beyond our control, which


could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking


statements.


There are many risks, uncertainties, and other factors that can prevent the company from achieving its goals or


cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed and/or implied by the forward-looking


statements contained in our comments. These factors and others are more fully discussed under Risk Factors in


GTT's Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in this call should be


evaluated in light of these important factors.


Our discussion this morning will refer to adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP measure. A presentation of


GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP financial measures is included


in the press release we issued yesterday which is available on our website.


I would now turn the call over to GTT's President and CEO, Rick Calder. Rick?
