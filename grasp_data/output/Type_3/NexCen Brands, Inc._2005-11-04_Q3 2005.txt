MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to today’s Aether Holdings’ Third Quarter 2005 Earnings


Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.


At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve


Bass.


Steven Bass


Thank you, Michelle [ph]. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Aether Holdings’ third quarter


2005 earnings call. Here with me today are David Oros, Aether’s Chairman and Chief Executive


Officer, and David Reymann, Aether’s Chief Financial Officer.


Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this call, management


may make forward-looking statements that involve estimates, assumptions, expectations, or


projections. We want to caution you that actual results may differ materially from those included in


any forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties.


For a description of risks and uncertainties that may affect Aether’s actual results and future


performance, we refer you to the ‘risk factors’ disclosure in our earnings release issued last evening


and included as an exhibit to the current report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC last evening


as well as our 2004 annual report on Form 10-Ka. Aether assumes no obligation to update any


forward-looking statements made during this call.


With that, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Reymann who will discuss our third quarter


results.


David C. Reymann, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Aether continues to operate in a very challenging


economic climate. Ongoing increases in the federal funds rate along with sustained flatness of the


yield curve have necessitated continuing to take a conservative approach when managing our


mortgage-backed security portfolio. As a result, Aether did not acquire additional mortgage-backed


securities during the third quarter, in fact we de-levered the MBS portfolio during the quarter. And


looking ahead, we do not intend to add to the mortgage-backed security portfolio in the near-term.


While we continue to conservatively manage our mortgage-backed security portfolio, we are


evaluating other opportunities that will more effectively realize the value from Aether’s


approximately $777 million in operating loss carry-forwards and approximately $272 million in


capital loss carry-forwards. As we have previously indicated, these opportunities could include


continuing our current MBS strategy if market conditions change significantly, extending the current


MBS strategy into other investment vehicles or investing in or acquiring profitable entities that will


effectively utilize our loss carry-forwards more quickly.


For the third quarter ended September 30, 2005, Aether reported income from continuing


operations of $238,000 or a penny a share versus $899,000 or 2 cents a share for the second


quarter ended June 30th ’05. The decrease in income from continuing operations mostly relates to


increases in borrowing costs associated with our MBS portfolio, which reduced interest rate


spreads that were generated from the portfolio. In the near-term, we anticipate continued spread


reduction as the short-term interest rates are projected to increase.

Total net loss reported for the third quarter was 835,000, which included a charge related to the


settlement of a claim associated with sale of our transportation business.


Last quarter, we provided guidance that Aether’s ongoing operating expenses excluding investment


advisor fees will be approximately $1 million per quarter. In Q3, we met that guidance with


operating expenses of $1,012,000. We expect Aether’s recurring quarterly operating expenses to


continue at the same level as we move forward.


Before I review the third quarter financials in detail, I want to remind you that on July 12th of 2005


at Aether’s Annual Shareholders’ meeting, we completed our corporate reorganization, which


basically protects our operating and capital loss carry-forwards that currently have a combined


value of over $1 billion. As a result of the reorganization, stockholders of Aether Systems received


one share of common stock of Aether Holdings in exchange for each share owned of Aether


Systems. While our new name is Aether Holdings Incorporated, we continue to trade on Nasdaq


under the ticker symbol AETH.


With that, let’s move onto the financial results for the quarter ended September 30th ’05. First, I’ll


review the balance sheet as of September 30, 2005. Aether’s balance sheet continues to be very


strong. We have a combined cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance of


approximately $31.1 million at September 30th ’05 versus $34.1 million at June 30th ’05. We have


a mortgage-backed security balance at fair market value of approximately $281.2 million at


September 30th ’05 versus a balance of $352 million at June 30 ’05. The approximately $71 million


decrease in mortgage-backed securities for the third quarter mostly related to the sale of roughly


$33.1 million of mortgage-backed securities along with principal repayments of approximately $34.8


million during the quarter. To enable us to reduce the amount of leverage associated with the


portfolio, the $33.1 million of mortgage-backed securities was sold for a loss of $159,000.


On the liability side of the balance sheet, the repurchase obligations line item was $181.7 at


September 30th ’05 down from the $253.1 million balance at June 30th ’05. The quarterly


decrease of approximately $71.4 million of repurchase obligations mostly relates to the sale of the


$33.1 million of mortgage-backed securities and the 34.8 million that we received in principal


repayments of MBS that I mentioned earlier.


Let’s move onto the income statement for the quarter ended 9/30/05. Interest income of 3,373,000


for Q3 of ’05 relates to income generated from our mortgage-backed portfolio, and interest expense


of 2,131,000 relates to the interest costs on our short-term repurchased agreements.


Some key metrics related to our Q3 results are as follows: The weighted average coupon of


Aether’s mortgage-backed securities at September 30 ’05 was 4.35% versus 4.44% on June 30th


’05. The weighted average annualized yield on average earning assets was 4.01% as of


September 30 ’05 versus 4.12% as of June 30, ’05. For the third quarter, our weighted average


cost of funds was 3.51% which equates to an interest rate spread of 0.5% for the quarter as


compared to the spread of 1.09% for the second quarter of this year. Additionally, the weighted


average constant prepayment rate on the MBS portfolio was 32.1% in Q3 as compared to 17% in


Q2 of this year.


The debt to equity ratio as of September 30 ’05 was 1.4:1, which is down from the June 30 ’05 debt


to equity ratio of 2:1. Total operating expenses were approximately 1.1 million for the third quarter


of ’05, down from approximately 1.4 million in the second quarter of ’05. The 1.1 million includes


approximately $108,000 in investment advisor fees. And as I noted earlier, excluding investment


advisor fees, we anticipate our future recurring operating expense run rate to be approximately a $1


million per quarter.
