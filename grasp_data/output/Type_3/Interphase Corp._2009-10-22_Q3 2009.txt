MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Interphase Third


Quarter 2009 Results. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.


Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder,


this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, October 22 of 2009.


It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Kalush, CEO and Chairman of


Interphase. Please go ahead sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Shannon, and good afternoon, everyone. I’d like to welcome you to our third quarter


2009 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin


our discussion with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter, and then I’ll conclude


with some brief remarks about our recent business activity. Then we can conclude the call with a


brief Q&A session.


With that, Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition and prospects of the company.


The actual results of the company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-


looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including without limitation changes


in product demand, the availability of products, changes in competition, economic conditions,


various inventory risks due to changes in market conditions and other risks indicated in the


Company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So, when used in


this call the words belief, plans, expects, intends, anticipates, and other similar expressions as they


relate to the company or its management are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months


of 2009. Revenues for the third quarter of 2009 were $4.4 million, representing a 37% decrease


from revenues in the third quarter of 2008 of $6.9 million. Revenues for the quarter were primarily


derived by broadband telecom revenues, which decreased approximately 45% to 3.6 million in the


third quarter of 2009, compared to 6.5 million for the third quarter of 2008.


Our professional services revenues increased to $368,000, compared to $209,000 on a year-to-


year basis. Additionally, enterprise product line revenues increased to $211,000 for the third quarter


of 2009, compared to $106,000 for the third quarter of 2008.


Revenues for the first nine months of 2009 decreased slightly to 20.9 million, compared to 21


million in the first nine months of 2008. Broadband telecom revenues increased slightly to 18.8


million for the first nine months of 2009 from 18.5 million for the same period in 2008.

Professional services revenues increased to $874,000 for the nine months ended September 30,


2009 from 347,000 for the same period in 2008. Enterprise product line revenues decreased to


$645,000 for the first nine months of 2009 compared to 735,000 for the first nine months of 2008.


Gross margin for the third quarter of 2009 was 25%, compared to 58% for the third quarter of 2008.


The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to revenue mix shift toward lower margin products.


Additionally during the quarter – during the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a $200,000 excess


and obsolete inventory charge. There were no similar charges in the third quarter of 2008.


Finally, gross margin was negatively impacted by the decrease in utilization of our manufacturing


facility during the quarter.


For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, gross margin was 51% compared to 54% for the


same period in 2008. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the effect of $973,000


related to project cancellation fee revenue recorded in the first quarter of 2008 which had no cost of


sales associated with it and therefore it was at 100% margin. In addition, gross margin was


negatively impacted by an increase of $300,000 in excess and obsolete inventory charges during


the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008.


Total operating expenses were $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to $4.2 million


for the third quarter of 2008. The details of our operating expense trends are as follows. Research


and development expenses decreased to $1.8 million for the third quarter 2009, down from 2


million for the third quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily due to two factors.


First, our reduction in project related research and development expenses of approximately


$120,000. And then secondly, much of our research and development resources are located in


France, and as such those costs are subject to exchange rate fluctuations with the euro and the


dollar. The dollar was stronger against the euro in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third


quarter of 2008, resulting in reduced R&D expenses in 2009.


Sales and marketing expenses were flat at $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30,


2009 and 2008. General and administrative expenses decreased to $860,000 for the third quarter


of 2009, compared to $990,000 for the third quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily due to the


reversal of previously accrued potential variable compensation award in the third quarter of 2009.


On a year-to-date basis, total operating expenses were $13.2 million for the first nine months of


2009, compared to 14.7 million for the first nine months of 2008. This decrease is primarily due to


four factors. First, a reduction in project related research and development expenses by


approximately $625,000 for the first nine months of 2009, compared to the first nine months of


2008. Secondly, a significantly stronger dollar against the euro in 2009 resulted in a decrease to


operating expenses of approximately $545,000 for the first nine months of 2009, compared to the


same period in 2008.


Third, the reduced head count and facility expenses related to the restructuring plan we undertook


in the first quarter of 2008 decreased operating expenses by approximately $500,000 for the first


nine months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.


And then finally, operating expenses for the first nine months of 2008 included a restructuring


charge of $403,000. There was no similar charge in the first nine months of 2009. These four


factors were partially offset by additional head count investments in the areas of sales and


marketing.


Our net loss for the third quarter of 2009 was $2.4 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.34,


compared to a net loss of $55,000, resulting in a loss per share of $0.01 for the third quarter of


2008. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, our net loss was $1.6 million, resulting in a
