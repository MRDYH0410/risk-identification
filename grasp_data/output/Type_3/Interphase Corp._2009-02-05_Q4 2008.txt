Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. This is Greg Kalush. I would like to welcome


you to our fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our


Chief Financial Officer who will begin with a discussion and overview of our financial performance

Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I would like to tank everybody for participating today and for your interest in


Interphase. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the


public. However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our


business, financial condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company


could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various


risks and uncertainties including without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of


products, changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in


market conditions and other risks indicated in the companies SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control and in


many cases the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause it’s actual


results to differ materially and those indicated by the forward-looking statements


So when used in this call, the words believes, plans, expects, intends, anticipates and other similar


expressions as it relates to the company or its management are intended to identify forward-looking


statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of


2008. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $5.2 million, representing a 42% decrease from


revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 of $9 million.


Revenues for the quarter were primarily derived by broadband telecom revenues, which decreased


approximately 38% to $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 7.7 million – excuse


me, for the fourth quarter of 2007. Our enterprise product line revenues decreased to $132,000 for


the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $971,000 for the fourth quarter of 2007.


For the full year of 2008, revenues decreased approximately 15% to 26.2 million compared to 30.8


million for the full year of 2007. Broadband telecom revenues decreased 11% to 23.2 million in


2008 compared to 26.1 million in 2007. Enterprise product revenues decreased to $867,000 for the


full year of 2008 compared to 3.4 million in 2007.

The gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $2.6 million or 50% compared to 4.8 million or


53% for the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was


primarily due to two factors.


First, we experienced reduced factory utilization in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the


fourth quarter of 2007. And secondly, we recorded an excess and obsolete inventory charge of


$200,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to the Nortel bankruptcy filing. We did not


record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2007 for excess and obsolete inventory. These two factors


were partially offset by a shift in our product mix in the fourth quarter of 2008 toward higher margin


products when compared to the same period in 2007.


Let me take a brief sidebar for a second to discuss the Nortel bankruptcy and its financial impact to


our company. Nortel filed for bankruptcy on January 14, 2009 and as of that date, we had


outstanding accounts receivable totaling $51,000, which we have fully reserved now on our balance


sheet at December 31, 2008.


Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we have – we also have inventory that is unique to products


that we sell directly to Nortel totaling approximately $140,000, which we have also fully reserved on


December 31, 2008 on our balance sheet. Therefore, the total impact of the Nortel filing is just


under $200,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008. We have no additional exposure with Nortel at this


time.


I’ll now return to our gross margin discussion. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 53%


for the full year of 2008 compared to 57% for 2007. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage


of revenue year-over-year was primarily due to two factors. First, there was a shift in our product


mix in 2008 toward lower margin products. And secondly, we experienced reduced factory


utilization in 2008 compared to 2007. These two factors were partially offset by recording $100,000


less excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2008 when compared to 2007.


Total operating expenses were $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008


compared to 5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. The details of our


operating expense trends are as follows.


Research and development expenses decreased to 1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 from


2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease is primarily due to four factors. First, the


impact of the restructuring plan undertaken in the first quarter of 2008 resulted in a reduction to


R&D expense of about $300,000. Second, we also had a reduction in project related research and


development expenses of approximately $300,000 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Third,


included in the research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 is a charge of


approximately $220,000 related to a software license procured for a product that was subsequently


discontinued. There was no similar charge during the fourth quarter of 2008. And finally, the euro to


dollar exchange rate was significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2007 when compared to the


fourth quarter of 2008, accounting for approximately $120, 000 of the decrease in the research and


development expenses.


Sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to 1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 from


1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of a


restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2008 and a reduction in variables sales


compensation due to reduced revenues for the quarter.


General and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008


from 1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the


utilization of outside services for consulting, legal and accounting expenses.
