MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interphase Third


Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-


only mode. Afterwards we’ll conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a


reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 23, 2008. I’d now like to turn the


conference over to Mr. Greg Kalush. Please proceed, sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Anthony. Good afternoon everyone, this is Greg Kalush, CEO and President of


Interphase Corporation. I’d like to welcome you to our third quarter 2008 earnings conference call.


With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin our discussion with an overview


of our financial performance, and I’ll then conclude with some updates in recent business activity.


Shortly thereafter we’ll conclude with a brief Q&A. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition, and prospects for the company. The actual results of the company could differ


materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Because of various risks and


uncertainties, including without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of products,


changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks, due to changes in market


condition, and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So, when used in


this call, the words “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates” and other similar


expressions as they relate to the Company or its management are intended to identify forward-


looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months


of 2008. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2008 were $6.9 million, representing


an 18% decrease from revenues in the third quarter of 2007 of $8.4 million. On a sequential basis,


revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% from revenues of 6.7 million for the second


quarter of 2008.


Revenues for the quarter were primarily driven by broadband telecom revenues, which decreased


approximately 10% to 6.5 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to 7.2 million for the third


quarter of 2007. On a sequential basis, however, broadband telecom revenues increased


approximately 5% to 6.2 million for the second quarter of 2008.


Our enterprise product line revenues decreased to $106,000 for the third quarter of 2008 compared


to $976,000 for the third quarter of 2007, and compared to $196,000 on a sequential basis.


Revenues for the first nine months of 2008 decreased approximately 4% to $21 million, compared


to 21.8 million for the first nine months of 2007. Broadband telecom revenues increased slightly to


18.5 million for the first nine months of 2008 from 18.4 million for the same period in 2007.

Enterprise product revenues decreased to $735,000 for the first nine months of 2008, compared to


$2.4 million for the first nine months of 2007.


The gross profit for the third quarter 2008 was $4 million, representing a 58% gross margin,


compared to 5.2 million and 61% for the third quarter of 2007. The decrease in gross margin


percentage was primarily driven by a shift in our product mix toward lower margin products and


reduced utilization of the manufacturing facility, partially offset by $100,000 less excess and


obsolete inventory charges during the third quarter of 2008, compared to the third quarter of 2007.


On a sequential basis, gross margin improved from 47% for the second quarter of 2008. This


improvement was primarily driven by product mix shift towards higher margin products in the third


quarter of 2008 when compared to the second quarter of 2008. Gross margin as a percentage of


revenue was 54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, compared to 59% for the first


nine months of 2007.


The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of 2008


compared to the first nine months of 2007 is primarily due to two factors. First, there was a shift in


our product mix in 2008 toward lower margin products. Second, we experienced reduced factory


utilization for the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007.


These two factors were partially offset by two positive contributors to gross margin. First, a


$973,000 project cancellation charge reported in the first quarter of 2008, which had no cost of


sales associated with it. And secondly, we recorded $300,000 less excess and obsolete inventory


charges during the first nine months of 2008, when compared to the same period in 2007.


Total operating expenses were $4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008,


compared to 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. The details of our operating


expense trends are as follows: research and development expenses decreased to $2 million for the


third quarter of 2008 from 2.4 million for the third quarter of 2007.


This decrease is primarily due to two factors. First, the impact of the restructuring plan undertaken


in the first quarter 2008, resulted in a reduction to research and development expense of


approximately $300,000. And secondly, we had a reduction in project related research and


development expenses of approximately $200,000 compared to the third quarter of 2007, when we


were preparing for several new product introductions, and we were conducting field trials at that


time.


These two factors were partially offset by the impact that the euro to dollar exchange rate had on


research and development expenses as the euro was stronger against the dollar in the third quarter


of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007.


Sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2008 from


$1.4 million for the third quarter of 2007. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of the


restructuring plan and a reduction in variable sales compensation due to the reduced revenues for


the quarter.


General and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $1 million for the third quarter of 2008


from $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2007. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the


utilization of outside services for consulting, legal and accounting expenses.


On a year-to-date basis, total operating expenses were basically flat at 14.7 million for the first nine


months of 2008, compared to 14.8 million for the first nine months of 2007. Our net loss for the third


quarter of 2008 was $55,000, resulting in a loss per share of $0.01, compared to a net income of


$698,000 resulting in earnings per share of $0.10 for the third quarter of 2007.
