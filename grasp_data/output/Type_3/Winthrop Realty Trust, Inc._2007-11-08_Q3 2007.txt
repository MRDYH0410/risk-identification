QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION


Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff


Langbaum with Bear Stearns. Please proceed with your question.


<Q – Jeffrey Langbaum>:
 
Hey guys. Mike can you go into a little bit of detail about the Concord


debt JV and kind of where that stands now and what the prospects are?


<A – Michael Ashner>:
 
The debt platform probably has about a 1.1 billion in assets, we have been


ramping it up as you may recall since the first quarter or the second quarter of 2006. We are


generating presently a levered yield after recurring expense of about 10.6%. I am devoting a great


deal of our resources into expanding the debt platform consistent with my view of where the


opportunities are in the current real estate environmental. I think Jeff you may have -- to answer


you better I think I’m going to need more detailed kind of questions. I noticed that -- I read your


report this morning and I noticed that you had made the comment or the comment came up that


you thought that we were hesitant because of the difficulty to the platform is [inaudible]. And to the


contrary the reason we have not been as aggressive in the third quarter with respect to investing is


we think that in view of the turmoil in the credit markets the opportunities are only gong to improve


and increase in the future and candidly with the decision more to keep our powder dry than for any


other -- than any other consideration.


<Q – Jeffrey Langbaum>:
 
What about access to capital both on the equity and on the debt side to


finance that stuff? I think as of last quarter you still had about 300 something million of assets that


were on the warehouse that you hadn’t put into a CDO yet, kind of -- if the opportunities got to the


point where you thought they made sense, would you, how would you even able to go about


jumping on them given the current financing environment?


<A – Michael Ashner>:
 
Well we are taking a number of steps, a number of different things; we


look at our capital structure in Concord as relatively slight and doing -- and each element of the


capital structure doing different things. To begin with, we are increasing our capital commitment


that is Winthrop as well as Lexington into the venture and we do as and when we need to put more


capital into the venture to make acquisitions. In addition, we are in the process of consummating,


although there is as usual no assurance, a preferred equity raise which will add considerable


amount of equity capital to the vehicle. When the markets became turbulent we took steps to


convert all of our shorter-term debt into -- debt having a duration of at least one year and we’ve


been successful in doing so with respect to all of our debts except for a small piece to about 40


million and we believe even that will be converted into long-term debt relatively shortly. In addition,


we are in the market now, we anticipate acquiring a longer-term, up to three-year revolver to assist


us with other additional acquisitions. So we are not -- while we are like all investors concerned and


we will maintain a concern with respect to the right side of our balance sheet, I believe that we have


addressed the issue, we either are addressing the issues or have addressed the issues, these


stand necessary to allow us to make the investments we anticipate making in the future.


<Q – Jeffrey Langbaum>:
 
Let me ask you just a quick follow-up about that preferred equity raise


that you mentioned, is that at the JV level or is that at the Winthrop level?


<A – Michael Ashner>:
 
It’s at the JV level.


<Q – Jeffrey Langbaum>:
 
And do you have a sense of what kind of pricing that you might be


talking about there?


<A – Michael Ashner>:
 
Expensive. More than I want to pay, all right. But it’s -- it will be, the pricing


will be accretive to our existing yield to our equity.
