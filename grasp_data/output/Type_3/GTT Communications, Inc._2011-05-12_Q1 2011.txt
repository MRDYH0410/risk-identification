Michael R. Bauer


Vice President, Finance & Controller, GTT Communications, Inc.


Thank you and good morning. I'm joined today by Rick Calder, GTT's President and CEO; Eric Swank GTT's


Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Thompson, GTT's Executive Chairman of the Board. Our discussion this


morning is being made available via webcast through our website. A replay of this call will be available for one


month. Dial-in information for the replay as well as access to a replay of the webcast is available on our website at


www.gt-t.net.


I'd also like to mention that our comments today will contain certain forward-looking statements within the


meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are predictive in nature that


depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that involve the use of words such as anticipates, expects,


intends, plans, believes, may, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


Forward-looking statements include, by way of example, revenue and margin expectations or projections and


various references to trends in the industry in GTT's business.


Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and


other factors, some beyond our control which could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from


those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. There are many risks, uncertainties and other factors that


can prevent the company from achieving its goals or cause the company's actual results to differ materially from


those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in our comments. These factors and


others are more fully discussed under Risk Factors in GTT's Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange


Commission. Statements in this call should be evaluated in light of these important factors.


Our discussion this morning will refer to adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP measure. A presentation of


GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP financial measures is presented


in the press release we issued yesterday, which is available on our website.


I will now turn the call over to GTT's President and CEO, Rick Calder. Rick?
