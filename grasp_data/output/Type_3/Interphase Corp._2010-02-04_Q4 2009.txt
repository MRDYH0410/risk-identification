MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009


Results Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.


Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder,


this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 4, 2010.


I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Kalush, CEO and President of Interphase.


Please go ahead, sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Benjamin , and good afternoon, everyone. This is, Greg Kalush, and I’d like to welcome


you to our fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our


Chief Financial Officer, who will begin our discussion with an overview of our financial performance


for the quarter and for the year, and then I’ll provide some updates on our recent business activity


and our outlook for 2010. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company could differ


materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, because of various risks and


uncertainties, including without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of products,


changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in market


conditions and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So when used in


this call, the words “believe”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “anticipate”, and other similar expressions as


they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009.


Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $4.7 million, representing a 10% decrease from


revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 of 5.2 million. Revenues for the quarter were primarily


derived by broadband telecom revenues, which decreased approximately 17% to 3.9 million for the


fourth quarter of 2009, compared to 4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Professional services


revenues increased to $410,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $154,000 for the fourth


quarter of 2008.


For the full year of 2009, revenues decreased slightly to 25.6 million, compared to 26.2 million for


the full year of 2008. Broadband telecom revenues decreased to 22.7 million in 2009 from 23.2


million in 2008. Professional services revenues increased to 1.3 million for 2009, compared to


$500,000 for 2008. Gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 37%, compared to


50% for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to our revenue


mix shift toward lower margin products.


Gross margin percentage for the full year of 2009 was 48% compared to 53% for the full year of


2008. The decrease in gross margin year-to-year was primarily driven by the effect of a $973,000


project cancellation fee revenue recorded in the first quarter of 2008 that had no cost of sales

associated with it. In addition, gross margin was negatively impacted by an increase of $300,000 in


excess and obsolete inventory charges during 2009 as compared to 2008.


Total operating expenses were $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 4.2 million for


the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 operating expenses included a one-time $1.2 million


restructuring charge. This charge relates to the plan announced in December of 2009 and was


undertaken to align the company’s spending with recent revenue trends and to enable additional


investments in strategic growth areas. The plan is expected to result in savings of over $1.5 million


in annualized operating costs.


The detail of the remaining operating expense trends are as follows. Research and development


expenses increased to $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 from 1.9 million for the fourth


quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily due to two main factors. First, much of our research and


development resources are located in France, and as such those costs are subject to exchange


rate fluctuations with the euro and the dollar. The euro was stronger against the dollar in the fourth


quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in increased research and


development expenses in 2009 of approximately $170,000. And secondly, there was an increase in


project-related research and development expenses of approximately $140,000 quarter-over-


quarter.


Sales and marketing expense increased to $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 from $1.2


million for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is primarily due to three factors. First, additional


strategic head count investments in sales and marketing resulted in an increase of approximately


$60,000. Second, the weaker dollar, that I just mentioned previously, also led to an increase in


sales and marketing expense of approximately $55,000. And finally, increased utilization of outside


sales representation and consulting services resulted in an increase of approximately $55,000.


General and administrative expense was flat at $1.1 million for the full – for the three months ended


December 31, 2009 and 2008.


For the full year of 2009, total operating expenses increased to $19.2 million compared to 18.9


million for 2008. The details of operating expense trends for the full year are as follows. Research


and development expense decreased to $8 million for 2009 from $9.2 million for 2008. This


decrease is primarily due to three factors. First, a reduction in project-related research and


development expenses by approximately $550,000 for 2009 compared to 2008. Second, the


reduced head count and facility expense, resulting from the restructuring plan we undertook in the


first quarter of 2008 decreased research and development expense by approximately $355,000


year-over-year. And third, a stronger dollar against the euro for the full year of 2009 resulted in a


decrease in research and development expense of approximately $300,000 for 2009 compared to


2008.


Sales and marketing expense increased to $5.8 million for 2009 from 5.2 million for 2008. This


increase is primarily due to two factors. First, additional strategic head count investments in sales


and marketing increased expenses for 2009 by approximately $380,000. Second, the increased


utilization of outside sales representation and consulting services resulted in additional expense of


approximately $250,000 in 2009 compared to 2008. These two factors were partially offset by a


stronger dollar in 2009 as well as the impact of a reduction in force undertaken during the first


quarter of 2008.


General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $4.3 million for 2009 from 4.1 million for


2008. Restructuring charges were included in total operating expenses for both 2009 and 2008. For


2009, the restructuring charge was $1.2 million and for 2008, the restructuring charge was


$403,000.
