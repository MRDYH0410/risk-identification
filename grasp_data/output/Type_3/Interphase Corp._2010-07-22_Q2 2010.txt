MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Interphase’s Second


Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is

Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman of the board, Chief Executive Officer & President


Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Greg Kalush. I would like to welcome


you to our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton our Chief


Financial officer who will begin our discussion with an overview of our financial performance for the


quarter, and then I’ll provide some updates on recent business activity. We will then conclude with


a brief Q&A period. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton, Jr., Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance & Treasurer


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in Interphase.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the public.


However, some of our discussion may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company could differ


materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, because of various risks and


uncertainties, including without limitation changes in product demand, the availability of product,


changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in market


conditions and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control. And in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So, when used in


this call the words, believes, plans, expects, intends, anticipate and other similar expressions as


they relate to the company or its management are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


I will now provide an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter of 2010.


Revenues for the second quarter of 2010 were $3.9 million, compared to 8.1 million for the second


quarter of 2009.


Revenues for the quarter were primarily impacted by broadband telecom revenues, which


decreased to $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to 7.2 million for the second


quarter of 2009. Our professional services revenues decreased to a $117,000 compared $257,000


on a year-to-date basis – on a year-to-year basis. Revenues for the first six months of 2010


decreased to 7.6 million, compared to 16.5 million for the first six months of 2009.


Broadband telecom revenues decreased to $6.4 million for the first half of 2010 from 15.2 million for


the same period of 2009. Professional services revenues decreased to $277,000 for the six months


ended June 30th, 2010 from $506,000 for the same period in 2009. Enterprise product line


revenues increased to 563,000 for the first six months of 2010, compared to 434,000 for the first six


months of 2009.


Gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2010 was 46%, compared to 55% for the


second quarter of 2009. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to decreased


utilization of our manufacturing facility and a shift in our product mix toward lower margin products.

Gross margin percentage was 48% for the first six months of 2010, compared to 57% for the first


six months of 2009. This decrease in gross margin on a year-to-date basis is also primarily due to


decreased utilization of our manufacturing facility, and a shift in our product mix toward lower


margin products.


Total operating expenses were 4 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to 4.7 million for


the second quarter of 2009. The details of our operating expense trends are as follows. Research


and development expenses were $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2010, down slightly from 1.9


million for the second quarter of 2009.


Sales and marketing expenses decreased to 1.3 million for the second quarter of 2010 from 1.6


million for the second quarter of 2009. This decrease in sales and marketing expense is primarily


the result of a decrease in commissions and variable compensation, compared to the same period


in the prior year.


General and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $954,000 for the second quarter of


2010, compared to approximately 1.1 million for the second quarter of 2009.


On a year-to-date basis, total operating expenses were $8.4 million for the first six months of 2010,


compared to $9.3 million for the first six months of 2009. The operating expense trend on a year-to-


date basis are as follows. Research and development expenses were essentially flat at 3.9 million


for the first half of 2010, compared to 4 million for the first half of 2009.


Sales and marketing expenses were 2.5 million for the first half of 2010, compared to 3.1 million for


the same period in 2009. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in commissions and variable


compensation, as well as the impact of the restructuring plan that we initiated in the fourth quarter


of 2009.


General and administrative expenses were $2 million for the first half of 2010, compared to 2.3


million for the first half of 2009. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the funding of


potential variable compensation awards.


Our net loss for the second quarter of 2010 was $2.2 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.32,


compared to a net income of $74,000, resulting in an income per fully diluted share of $0.01 for the


second quarter of 2009.


For the six months ended June 30, 2010, our net loss was 4.6 million, resulting in a loss per share


of $0.67, compared to a net income of 781,000, resulting in an income per fully diluted share of


$0.11 for the same period in 2009.


Turning to the balance sheet, our working capital position decreased approximately $1.9 million


during the quarter to 17.1 million. Our cash and securities position also decreased approximately


$1.9 million to 14 million.


As always, we will continue to carefully manage our working capital and cash and securities


position, as our balance sheet strength has been critical during this downturn in our business, and


will be even more important as we look to take advantage of future growth and investment


opportunities.


I will now turn it back over to Greg who will add some perspective to the significant events and


accomplishments within our business. Greg?
