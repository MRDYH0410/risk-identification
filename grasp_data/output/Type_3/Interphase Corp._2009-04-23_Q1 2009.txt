MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interphase First


Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-


only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As


a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 23, 2009.


I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Kalush, Chairman and CEO of Interphase.


Please proceed.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Anthony and good afternoon everyone. This is Greg Kalush. I’d like to welcome you to our


first quarter earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer. And I’ll


turn the call over to Tom, who’ll give you a brief overview of our financial performance for the


quarter, and then I’ll provide you some business updates, and we’ll conclude with a brief question-


and-answer period. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody today for participating today and for your interest in


Interphase. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections for the


public. However some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our


business, financial condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company


could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various


risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of


products, changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in


market conditions, and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So when used in


this call, the words believes, plans, expects, intends, anticipates, and other similar expressions as


they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of 2009. Revenues for


the first quarter of 2009 were $8.4 million, representing a 13% increase over revenues for the first


quarter of 2008 of $7.5 million. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 61% sequentially


when compared to revenues of 5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenues for the quarter


were primarily driven by broadband telecom revenues, which increased approximately 38% to $8


million for the first quarter of 2009 compared to 5.8 million for the first quarter of 2008.


Our Professional Services revenues increased to 249,000 for the first quarter of 2009 compared to


117,000 for the first quarter of 2008. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2009 was $5 million or


60% compared to 4.3 million or 58% for the first quarter of 2008. The increase in gross margin as a


percentage of revenue was primarily driven by two factors.


First, we experienced a favorable shift in our product mix in the first quarter of 2009 toward higher


margin products when compared to the first quarter of 2008. And then secondly, our factory


utilization increased during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008, as


production volumes increased year-over-year. These two factors were partially offset by project


cancellation fee revenues of $973,000 from the first quarter of 2008, which had no cost of sales tied


to it, and therefore resulted in a 100% margin. And the recording of the $100,000 in excess and

obsolete inventory charges in the first quarter of 2009. There were no excess and obsolete


inventory charges in the first quarter of 2008.


Total operating expenses were 4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared to


5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The details of our operating expense trends


as follows: research and development expenses decreased to $2 million for the first quarter of 2009


from 2.9 million for the first quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily due to four factors.


First, the impact of the restructuring plan undertaken in the first quarter of 2008 resulted in a


reduction to R&D expense of approximately $310,000 year-over-year. Secondly, we had a


reduction in project related research and development expenses of approximately $240,000


compared to the first quarter in 2008.


Third, the euro to dollar exchange rate was significantly higher in the first quarter of 2008 compared


to the first quarter of 2009, accounting for approximately $180,000 of the decrease in research and


development expense. And finally, included in our research and development expense in the first


quarter of 2008 is a charge of approximately $70,000 related to a software license that was


procured for a product that was subsequently discontinued. There is no similar charge during the


first quarter of 2009.


Sales and marketing expenses were unchanged at $1.5 million for both the first quarter of 2009 and


2008. General and administrative expenses increased to 1.2 million for the first quarter of 2009


from 908,000 for the first quarter of 2008. This increase is primarily due to the utilization of outside


services for consulting, legal and accounting expenses, and variable compensation charges as the


company’s financial results have improved significantly over the prior year.


Additionally, total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2008 included a restructuring charge of


$365,000. There are no similar charges in the first quarter of 2009. Our net income for the first


quarter of 2009 was $707,000 resulting in an income per fully diluted share of $0.11. Compared to


a net loss of $528,000 resulting in a loss per share of $0.08 for the first quarter of 2008.


Turning to our balance sheet, our working capital position increased approximately $1.1 million


during the quarter to 26.4 million. Our cash and securities position decreased during the quarter to


17.4 million at March 31, 2009, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable that was driven


by our 61% sequential increase in revenue.


As always, we will continue to judiciously manage our working capital position and cash and


securities positions, as we believe that our balance sheet strength is an important enabler for us to


take full advantage of our future growth and investment opportunities for our business.


I’ll now turn it back over to Greg who will add some perspective to the significant events and


accomplishments during the quarter. Greg?


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Tom. I guess I’d like to begin by saying, wow, what a quarter! At the beginning of the


year, we anticipated a continuation of the relatively sluggish demand that we saw in 2008, but


instead, we are off to a great start for 2009. We began the year with a very solid performance both


in terms of revenue growth and profit generation.


During the quarter, we began to ramp up shipments of products that were actually designed in a


couple of years ago, but as these things happen within this industry, we are now seeing our


customers demand ramping up as there were new placements in the marketplace, especially in


Asia.
