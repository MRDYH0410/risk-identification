not recognized revenue from the sale of their implanters and so we achieved final customer


acceptance of the equipment upon installation at the customers place.


Gross profit for the quarter with 24,000 compared to a negative 23,000 in the prior quarter and 3.6


million in the prior year third quarter, again reflecting the process associated with the recognition of


implanter revenues and in that quarter. The improvement in gross profit compared to the prior


quarter primarily reflects higher margin associated with increased licensing revenues during the


third quarter.


Operating expenses for the quarter were approximately 2.2 million compared to 2.6 million in the


previous quarter, and 2.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Compared to the 2004 third


quarter D&A is down by 24,000 due to decrease in legal and insurance cost, partially offset by an


increase in consulting and patent amortization cost.


Now when you are marketing is done by 104,000 due to a reduction in headcount and reduced


occupancy cost associated with the move to a single location completed last quarter. R&D has


been reduced substantially to down 356,000 for prior years third quarter primarily as a result of


decrease in wafer support functions and depreciation associated primarily with leasehold


improvements. R&D is also down substantially from the prior quarter by 197,000 primarily


reflecting reduction on occupancy cost previously mentioned of 83,000 a reduction of repair and


maintenance of 42,000 and a reduction and amortization of leasehold improvement of 30,000.


Loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 was 2.1 million or a negative $0.19 per


share with a gain of 165,000 were $0.01 per share from discontinued operations recorded during


the quarter. This compares to a loss of – from continuing operations of 2.6 million or a loss $0.24


per share, before it was from discontinued operations of 57,000 in preceding quarter and a profit


from continuing operations of 1.1 million or $0.10 per share before a loss from discontinued


operations of 2.8 million were $0.26 per share in the third quarter of the preceding year. Net loss


for the third quarter of 2005 was 1.9 million or a loss of $0.18 per share. Net loss in the preceding


quarter was 2.6 million or $0.25 per share and net loss in the third quarter of 2004 was 1.7 million


or a loss of $0.16 per share.


For the first 9 months of 2005 total revenues were 528,000 this compares to 7.7 million for the first


9 months of last year including 7 million of equipment revenue waited for the sales of implanter.


Loss from continuing operations for the first 9 months of 2005 was 7.4 million or a loss of $0.69 per


share compared to a loss from continuing operations in the first 9 months of the prior year of 3


million or loss of $0.28 per share.


Net loss for the first 9 months of 2005 was 7.3 million or a loss of $0.68 per share including a gain


from discontinued operations of 150,000 or $0.1 per share. This compares to a net loss of 8.5


million or a loss of $0.80 per share including a loss for discontinued operations of 5.5 million or


$0.52 per share for the same period last year.


We, ended the quarter with about 6 million in cash. In June we announced the shipment in


SUMCO tool as a result of attaining factory acceptance from the customer. With the remains of the


final acceptance came at 1.2 million upon attainment of specified performance criteria, currently


expected by year end or early in the first quarter of 2006. We believed we will have sufficient cash


on hand to support operations and current levels till the second quarter of 2006. With both, the final


acceptance payment from the SUMCO order received earlier this year and the down payment and


subsequent progress payments associated with the new order. We believe we will have sufficient


cash available to fund current level of operations through at least the fourth quarter of 2006.


We caution that our expectations are based on our current operating plans in general sales outlook


each of which may change rapidly. Further the timing of final acceptance of both SUMCO tools, the


timings of future equipment orders and the adoption of SIMOX technology are dependent on the
