MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


[Operator Instructions]: Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second


Quarter 2007 Results Interphase Conference Call. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and


answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 26, 2007. It is


now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Greg Kalush, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone, this is Greg Kalush, CEO and President of


Interphase Corporation. I’d like to welcome you to this call to discuss our second quarter 2007


earnings, and also thank for your interest in our company. With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief


Financial Officer, who will begin our discussion with an overview of our financial performance for


the quarter, and as pointed out earlier, we will have a brief Q & A period afterward. Tom?


Thomas Tipton, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance


Thanks, Greg. I’d like to thank everybody for participating today, and for your interest in


Interphase. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we do not make financial projections to the


public.


However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking statements about our business,


financial condition, and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company could differ


materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, because of various risks and


uncertainties, including, without limitation, changes in product demand; the availability of products;


changes in competition; economic conditions; various inventory risks due to changes in market


conditions; and other risks indicated in the company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the forgoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in


many cases, the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results


to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.


So, when used in this call, the words “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” and


other similar expressions, as they relate to the company or


its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. I’ll now provide an overview


of our financial performance for the second quarter, and first 6 months of 2007.


Revenues for the 3 months ended June 30, 2007 were $8.2 million, representing a 12% decrease


from revenues in the second quarter of 2006, of $9.4 million. To put this trend into perspective, the


second quarter of 2006 was a high water mark, in terms of quarterly revenue for the year. In fact, it


was also a high water mark in terms of our quarterly revenue since the second quarter of 2004.


While we were delighted at the time, in hindsight, it may have been more of an anomaly in our


customers’ buying patterns. That said, we are very pleased that our quarterly revenues have


returned to a more normal business level. Our second quarter 2007 revenues increased


approximately 61% when compared to first quarter 2007 revenues of $5.1 million. This sequential


increase in revenues was primarily driven by our tier one customers returning to a more normal


buying pattern of our current products as the impact of the recent merger activity in the industry is


beginning to stabilize.


Broadbrand telecom revenues for the second quarter of 2007 declined approximately 7% to $7.2


million compared to 7.8 million in the second quarter of 2006. On a sequential basis broadband


telecom revenues increased approximately 78% driving our revenue increase when compared to


the first quarter of 2007. As expected our enterprise product line revenues declined to $695,000 for

the second quarter of 2007 compared to approximately $1.3 million for the second quarter of 2006.


All other revenues were approximately $340,000 for the second quarter of 2007 compared to


approximately $320,000 for the second quarter of 2006.


Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were 13.3 million compared to 17.5 million in the


first half of 2006. Broadband telecom revenues declined approximately 23% to 11.3 million for the


first half of 2007 from 13.9 million for the same period in 2006. This decrease was primarily due to


the impact of the industries merger activity and that impact it had on its R tier 1 [ph] customers.


Again as expected, Enterprise product revenues decreased to 1.4 million for the first six months of


2007 compared to 2.5 million for the first six months of 2006.


All other revenues were approximately 675,000 for the first half of 2007 compared to 1.1 million for


the first half of 2006. The gross margin for the second quarter of 2007 was 4.9 million or 60%


compared to 5.4 million or 58% for the second quarter of 2006. The increase in gross margin


percentage was primarily driven by a shift in our product mix toward higher margin products


partially offset by reduced factory utilization when compared to the second quarter of 2006. Gross


margin as a percentage of revenue was 57% for the first six months of 2007 compared to 54% for


the first six months of 2006.


The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the first half of 2007 compared to the


first half of 2006 is due to several factors. First there was a shift in our product mix in 2007 toward


higher margin products. Secondly in the first quarter of 2006 we sold approximately $400,000 in


excess inventory at cost, thus negatively impacting our 2006 gross margin. Our excess and


obsolete inventory charges for the first half of 2007 were $100,000 less when compared to the


same period in 2006. These three factors were partially offset by reduced factory utilization for the


first six months of 2007 when compared to the same period in 2006.


Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2007 were $4.9 million compared to


$4.7 million for the second quarter of 2006. The details of our operating expense trends are as


follows. Research and development expenses increased to 2.4 million for the second quarter of


2007, up from 2 million for the second quarter of 2006. This increase is due to a continued


investment in project related research and development activities on a variable basis as we


continue to prepare for several new product introductions and a number of field trials scheduled for


later this year. Sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to 1.4 million for the second


quarter of 2007, from 1.5 million for the second quarter of 2006.


This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in variable compensation costs. General and


administrative expenses decreased slightly to 1.1 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared


to 1.2 million in the second quarter of 2006. This decrease is also primarily due to a decrease in


variable compensation costs. Total operating expenses were $9.8 million for the first six months of


2007, compared to $8.9 million for the first six months of 2006. This increase is due to our


continued investment in project related research and development activities, as both sales and


marketing and general administrative expenses were down year-over-year.


We will continue to focus our resources in the area of research and development as we concentrate


on delivering our new Advanced TCA(r) and Advanced NC [ph] products to our customers, and


help them ensure a timely launch of their product lines. Net income for the second quarter of 2007


was $390,000, resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of 6 cents. Net income was down


compared to the second quarter of 2006 when we reported a net income of 1.4 million, resulting in


fully diluted earnings per share of $0.19. But it represented a significant improvement when


compared to our net loss of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2007, which resulted in a loss per


share of $0.30.


For the six months ended June 30th, 2007, our net loss was $1.5 million, resulting in a loss per


share of $0. 24. Our net income for the first half of 2006 was $1.5 million, resulting in fully diluted
