MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Interphase Second Quarter 2008 Results


Conference Call. Afterwards we’ll conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]


As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 24 of 2008. It is now my


pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Kalush, President and Chief Executive Officer.


Please go ahead sir.


Gregory B. Kalush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This is Greg Kalush. I’d like to welcome you to our


second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me is Tom Tipton, our Chief Financial Officer


who will begin our discussion with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter and


then I’ll provide some brief updates on our recent business activity. We’ll then conclude with a brief


Q&A. Tom?


Thomas N. Tipton Jr., Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Greg. I would like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in


Intephase. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that we did not make financial projections for the


public. However, some of our discussions may contain forward-looking-statements about our


business, financial condition and prospects of the company. The actual results of the company


could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, because of various


risks and uncertainties, including without limitation, changes in product demand, the availability of


products, changes in competition, economic conditions, various inventory risks due to changes in


market conditions and other risks indicated in the Company’s SEC filings and reports.


All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control and in


many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual


results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. So when used in


this call the words “believes”, “plans”, “expects”, “intends”, “anticipates”, and other similar


expressions, as they relate to the company, or its management, are intended to identify forward-


looking statements.


I’ll now provide an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter and first six months


of 2008.


Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was $6.7 million representing a 19%


decrease from revenues in the second quarter 2007 of $8.2 million. Revenues for the quarter were


down sequentially when compared to revenues of 7.5 million for the first quarter of 2008, however,


the first quarter of 2008 revenues included a one-time project cancellation fee of $973,000 for


unique customer requirements related to product development work that was discontinued,


therefore product revenues actually increased by approximately $150,000 on a sequential basis.


Revenues in the quarter were primarily driven by broadband telecom revenues, which decreased to


14% to $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared to $7.2 million for the second quarter


of 2007.


Our enterprise product line revenues decreased to $196,000 for the second quarter of 2008


compared to $695,000 for the second quarter of 2007. Revenues for the first six months of 2008


increased approximately 6% to $14.1 million compared to $13.3 million for the first six months of


2007.

Broadband telecom revenues increased approximately 6% to $12 million for the first half of 2008


from $11.3 million for the same period in 2007. Enterprise product revenues decreased to $629,000


for the first six months of 2008 compared to $1.4 million for the first six months of 2007. The gross


margin for the second quarter of 2008 was $3.1 million or 47%, compared to $4.9 million or 60% for


the second quarter of 2007. This decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by a


shift in our product mix toward lower products and reduced utilization of our main manufacturing


facility. These factors were partially offset by $100,000 less excess and obsolete inventory charges


taken during the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007.


Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 53% for the first six months of 2008, compared to


57% for the first six months of 2007. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for


the first half of 2008, compared to the first half of 2007 is primarily due to two factors. First the shift


in product mix in 2008 toward lower margin products and then secondly our reduced factory


utilization during the first six months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. These two


factors were partially offset by the $973,000 project cancellation charge recorded in the first quarter


of 2008 which had no cost of sales associated with it. These two factors were further offset by


$200,000 less excess and obsolete inventory charges during the first half of 2008 when compared


to the same period in 2007.


Total operating expenses were $4.9 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2008 and


2007. The details of our operating expense trends are as follows. Research and development


expenses increased to $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2008, up from $2.4 million for the


second quarter of 2007. This increase is primarily due to two factors.


First, much of the company’s research and development resources are located in France, and as


such, those costs are subject to the exchange rate fluctuations with the euro and the dollar. The


euro was significantly stronger against the dollar in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the


second quarter of 2007. This exchange rate fluctuation resulted in an increase to research and


development expense of approximately $200,000 year-to-year. That being said, we have taken


steps to mitigate this exposure by strategically acquiring foreign exchange contracts to purchase a


fixed amount of euros, on a specific date in the future, at predetermined rates established by


contract.


In addition, the French Tax Administration has improved its R&D tax credit program by increasing


the available credit from 10% in 2007 to 30% for 2008. Although the foreign exchange contract


gains and the tax credit do not offset the impact of the euro translation at the operating expense


level, these two items do help to offset the negative exchange rate impact to this quarter at the


bottom line.


The second factor for the expense increase was that research and development expense in the


second quarter of 2008 included a charge of approximately $115,000 related to software procured


for a product that was subsequently discontinued. These two factors were partially offset by the


actions taken as part of the restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2008.


Sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to $1.2 million for the second quarter of 2008


from 1.4 million for the second quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of


the restructuring plan and the reduction of variable sales compensation due to reduced revenues


for the quarter.


General and Administrative expenses were flat at $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2008


compared to the second quarter of 2007. On a year-to-date basis, total operating expenses were


$10.5 million for the first six months of 2008, compared to $9.8 million for the first six months of


2007. This increase is due to three main factors. First, we incurred $403,000 of restructuring


charges in the first half of 2008 due to the restructuring actions initiated in the first quarter. Second,


the euro impacted our French based research and development expenses as the euro was
