MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to NexCen Brands Conference Call


to discuss its financial results for the Second Quarter of 2009. [Operator Instructions].


I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Ms. Leigh Parrish of FD. Please go


ahead Leigh.


Leigh Parrish, Financial Dynamics


Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your


participation and interest. With us on the call are Chief Executive Officer Ken Hall and Chief


Financial Officer Mark Stanko. NexCen issued a press release and filed with the Securities and


Exchange Commission its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2009. The


release and the quarterly report are both available on the company’s website at


www.nexcenbrands.com.


Before we begin, please keep in mind that this call will contain forward-looking statements. All


forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to


differ materially from certain expectations discussed here today. These risk factors are explained in


detail in the company’s SEC filing. NexCen does not undertake any obligation to publically update


or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or


otherwise.


And now, I’m pleased to introduce Ken Hall, Chief Executive Officer. Ken?


Kenneth J. Hall, Chief Executive Officer


Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for today’s call. Also joining me is Mark


Stanko, the Chief Financial Officer of NexCen Brands. We will discuss the results for the second


quarter of 2009 and communicate some of our operating highlights that are contributing to our


performance. Later, I will also discuss some of the recent activity in our franchise business.


This afternoon we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our quarterly report on Form


10-Q for the second quarter 2009. We also issued a press release announcing certain financial


results for the second quarter. Completing our outstanding SEC filings along with executing our


turnaround plan have been our priorities throughout 2009. For over – over the last 90 days, we


have filed our amended 2007 10-K, 2008 10-K and the 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of


2009. We expect to announce and file our third quarter results in the near-term. Let there be no


doubt, we are committed to regaining compliance with all SEC reporting requirements.


Now turning to a review of our second quarter results. I will provide a few brief highlights and then


Mark will review the results in more detail.


The second quarter of 2009 marks the second consecutive quarter that we have generated


operating income and positive cash flow from operations since we implemented our revised


strategic plan last year. We also reported total revenues of 11.8 million compared to 11.9 million for


the same period last year. Given the economic environment, we were pleased to maintain revenues


at the prior year levels, despite the dramatic drop in mall traffic and retail spending this year. We


realized significant year-over-year improvements in our financial results by effectively managing our


expenses.

As many of you are aware, we incurred some material special charges and expenses in 2008 which


skew our year-over-year comparison of financial results. So in our press release, and here, we refer


to certain adjusted results which back out these special items because we believe the adjusted


non-GAAP numbers provide a more meaningful comparison.


Year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis show more dramatic improvements. But even on an


adjusted year-over-year comparison, we reduced operating expenses by 21% to $10.1 million in


the second quarter of 2009, increased our operating income by 286% to $1.7 million and reduced


our loss from continuing operations by $0.07 per fully diluted share to a loss of a penny per share


or $800,000.


We also generated positive cash flow from continuing operations of $200,000 in the second quarter


of 2009 compared to cash used in operations of $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. For the


first half of 2009, compared to the second period in 2008, we improved cash flow from operations


by $6.3 million to $600,000 and we anticipate further improvements in operating cash flows going


forward.


Briefly looking back at our results for the first half of the year, we have seen significant financial and


operational improvements in our business. While it has been a challenging sales environment and


we expect that trend to continue, our efforts to introduce innovative new products, streamline the


business and reduce operating expenses through strategic cost reduction initiatives are positively


impacting our financial performance. Overall, we are operating in a much stronger organization


than we were last year. We have continued to make progress in improving our business, and our


brands, and remain committed to executing our turnaround plan.


Now, I would like turn the call over to Mark who will review the results in more detail. Mark?


Mark E. Stanko, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer


Thanks, Ken. I will briefly discuss selected financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.


Please note that our financial results are described more fully in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q


which we filed today.


Total revenues for the second quarter of 2009 decreased a modest 1% to $11.8 million compared


to $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in revenues is a result of the decline in


royalty and factory revenues in light of current economic conditions, partially offset by an increase


in franchise fee revenues related to development deals signed in 2008.


Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2009 decreased 92%, or $115.1 million. As Ken


noted, we recorded special items in 2008, including impairment charges related to intangible


assets, professional fees related to special investigations and restructuring costs. Excluding these


special items specific to the events of 2008, adjusted total operating expenses decreased 21% or


$2.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2008. This significant decrease is a result of the


company’s ongoing cost reduction initiatives.


Due to the reduced operating expenses, we realized operating income of $1.6 million in the second


quarter of 2009, compared to an operating loss of $113.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. On


a non-GAAP adjusted basis, we realized operating income of $1.7 million compared to an operating


loss of $900,000 in the second quarter of 2008, an improvement of $2.6. million. Loss from


continuing operations in the second quarter of 2009 was $800,000, or a penny per fully diluted


share. This was an improvement from the loss from continuing operations in the second quarter of


2008 of $112.8 million or a loss of $1.99 per fully diluted share, which includes the aforementioned


special items. Excluding special items, adjusted loss from continuing operations in the second


quarter of 2008, was $4.5 million or a loss of $0.08 per fully diluted share.
