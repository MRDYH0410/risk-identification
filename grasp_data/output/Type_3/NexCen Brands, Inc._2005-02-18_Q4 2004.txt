MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, and welcome to today's Aether


Systems' Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2004 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being


recorded.


At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr.


Steve Bass. Please go ahead, sir.


Steven Bass, Investor Relations


Thank you, Regina [ph]. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Aether Systems' fourth quarter


and year-end 2004 earnings call. Here with me today are Dave Oros, Aether's Chairman and Chief


Executive Officer and Dave Reymann, Aether's Chief Financial Officer.


Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, management may


make forward-looking statements that involve estimates, assumptions, expectations or projections.


We do want to caution you that actual results may differ materially from those included in any


forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties. For a description of risks


and uncertainties that may affect Aether's actual results and future performance, we refer you to the


risk factors disclosure in our earnings release issued last evening and included as an exhibit to the


current report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC last evening, our 2003 annual report on Form


10-K, the current report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on June 10, 2004 and the quarterly


report on Form 10-Q for our third quarter of 2004 which we filed with the SEC on November 9,


2004. Aether assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this


call.


With that, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Reymann who will discuss our fourth quarter


results.


David C. Reymann, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and welcome everyone. The transition out of Aether's wireless


business is almost complete. The operating expenses for Q4 of 2004 represent a final full quarter


of transitional costs related to exiting the wireless business. With the significantly lower ongoing


operating expense level in 2005, we project a combined cash balance at the end of Q1 ’05 to be


higher than the December 31, 2004 cash balance which is approximately a $132 million. In


addition to the transitional services activities occurring during Q4, we also redeemed a $154.9


million of Aether’s convertible subordinated notes payable on October 4th.


During the third quarter conference call, we projected a clean balance sheet as of December 31,


2004. We have achieved that goal with approximately a $132 million of the $137 million in total


assets at 12/31/04 representing Aether’s combined cash balances. This leaves only $5 million in


non-cash-related assets on the balance sheet as of that date. On the liability side of the balance


sheet, total liabilities went from at September 30, 2004 balance of a 163 million to December 31,


2004 balance of only 6 million.


During our third quarter conference call, we also talked about carefully evaluating market conditions


to effectively deploy our capital so as to maximize value to our shareholders. With recent Federal


Reserve interest rate activity, as of year-end, we have not begun to lever our residential mortgage-


backed portfolio. As of 12/31/04, we had approximately $62 million of Aether’s cash invested in

residential mortgage-backed securities. Our strong cash position and significant operating and


capital loss carry-forwards place Aether in a very unique position that we want to optimize to our


shareholders. We expect to continue to focus on the residential mortgage-backed security strategy


while we are considering other strategies and investment vehicles that might allow us to achieve


our objectives more quickly.


With that, I will review the financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. First,


let’s focus on the balance sheet as of 12/31/04. We have a combined cash balance of $131.7


million as of December ’04. This combined cash balance includes cash and cash equivalents,


residential mortgage-backed securities and restricted cash. When comparing the cash line items


on the balance sheet as of December 31st ’04 versus September 30th ’04, cash decreased by a


$160.9 million for the quarter. This decrease mostly related to the repayment of Aether’s


convertible subordinated notes payable totaling a $157 million.


The $157 million breaks down as follows: a $154.9 million related to the note principal repayment,


$1.9 million related to the note call premium and the remaining amount related to accrued interest


payments associated with the note.


$2.9 million of the remaining use of cash related to our Q4 ’04 operating loss and a $1 million which


is the remaining burn is mostly due to restructuring payments and working capital payments. The


mortgage-backed security line item on the balance sheet increased approximately $41 million in Q4


of ’04 versus the 9/30/04 balance which is the direct result of additional mortgage-backed securities


that will purchased in the month of October.


Moving to the liabilities portion of the balance sheet, the convertible subordinated notes payable


balance is 0 as of the end of the year, and this is due to the repayment of the notes that I already


discussed.


Let's move onto the income statement for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Interest income


of $672,000 for Q4 of ’04 relates to income from our residential mortgage-backed securities


portfolio. Interest expense was 0 for the quarter as we have not yet levered the portfolio. Moving


down to the operating expense section of the income statement, selling, general and administrative


expenses were approximately $2.5 million for the quarter. Most of these expenses relate to


transitional costs associated with selling the wireless divisions. The key message related to


Aether’s operating expenses is that the transitional activities and related costs associated with


divesting the wireless business are almost complete. While we have some of these transitional


costs that were still in the Q1 of ’05, we anticipate an ongoing quarterly operating expense run rate


of less than $1 million per quarter.


Moving down, the P&L depreciation expense increased to $664,000 for the fourth quarter. This


amount includes a write-off of assets that related to the wireless business. In Q1 of 2005,


depreciation expense will be significantly lower as a direct result of having only $367,000 in


depreciable furniture, computers and fixtures on the balance sheet as of year-end.


Restructuring charges were $406,000 for the fourth quarter. This amount related mostly to


severance payments and costs related to facilities closure associated with the transition. Interest


income from money market accounts of $285,000 is a result of interest earned on cash that we had


actually invested in associated money market accounts.


The loss on early retirement of debt of 2,419,000 is a direct result of the redemption of Aether’s


notes. $1.9 million of this loss relates to the note for offering him and the remainder is from the


write-off of notes – of the note related to deferred financing costs that we have residing on the


balance sheet prior to redemption. The result of all this activity is a net loss from continuing


operations of $3,690,000 were 8 cents per share. Excuse me – that’s the review of the financials


for the quarter in the year. And with that I would like to turn over to questions.
