Thank you very much for joining us this afternoon and welcome to the first quarter review of Uni-Select. My name


is Richard Roy, President and CEO. With me today are Denis Mathieu, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;


and also Gary O'Connor, Executive Vice President. Joining us on the line also is Willie Alexander, Executive Vice

I will begin the presentation by talking a little bit about some changes in the reporting currency and also to the


financial statement. Since the 1st of January this year, we have chosen the American dollar as the reporting


currency on the consolidated financial statement. This decision was a result of our significant development in the

U.S. and as a result, we came to the conclusion that it was more pertinent and economically representative to use


the U.S. currency as the reporting currency. The decision will reduce changes due to the fluctuation of currencies


on the financial statement.


Also, our interim financial statement has been prepared in accordance with policies set under the first time


adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards.


I will present the first quarter operational highlights and Denis Mathieu will add more flavor with respect to the


impact of those accounting changes on our results and then I will conclude.

quarter increased by $101 million at $396.8 million. And that increase is mainly made of course of the impact of


the acquisition of FinishMaster. There has been, on the Canadian operation now, still a small variation in currency


exchange which added revenues by about $6 million. Stores that had been closed or sold in previous quarters had
