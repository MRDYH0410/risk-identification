MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Welcome to Vector Group’s Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Before the


call begins, I would like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.


Now, I would like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s second quarter 2010


earnings conference call.


With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of Liggett Vector Brands and Liggett; and


Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call, I will provide an update on our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the second quarter and first half of 2010. Ron, will then discuss the performance of Liggett for the


period and provide his perspective on industry developments and the competitive environment.


After that, we will take your questions.


Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our company’s continued strong performance


and volume growth trends during the second quarter of 2010. As we have previously noted in


anticipation of the April 2009 legislation that increased the federal excise tax on cigarette by $6.17


per carton and pending legislation that ultimately granted the Food and Drug Administration


regulatory authority over tobacco products, we’ve made the decision to strategically invest in the


growth of our tobacco business.


The success of the strategy that we put into place has reflected in Liggett Vector brands second


quarter 2010 wholesale shipment growth in excess of 30% while the overall industry declined by


over 7%. Beyond the short-term, we are committed to a program of sustainable growth in our


tobacco business and Ron will provide more detail on that in a moment.


With respect to real estate, we continue to see positive signs in a challenging market environment


and our results in New Valley and Douglas Elliman are improving. We still believe that there are


good investment opportunities in this market and we plan to make appropriate investments when


the opportunities meet our criteria.


At this point, I want to briefly address the tobacco litigation environment and especially


developments related to the Engle cases. As previously noted, the primary focus of our litigation


activity currently is the Engle progeny cases in Florida. There are approximately 7,000 cases


pending with more than half of them in Federal Court and the rest in Florida State Court.


We along with the other industry defendants continue to believe that the Engle process is materially


flawed and unconstitutional. While we believe we’ve very strong arguments and have recently


received a potentially significant favorable ruling in Federal Court, there is considerable risk and we


remain subject to the ongoing process and periodic negative judgments.

For example in June, we paid $14.4 million to resolve the judgment in the Lukacs case. This is the


largest judgment against Liggett to date and this was a result of what we believe to be unique


circumstances.


Lukacs was the first Engle progeny case tried and the judgment was entered years in advance of


the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling on the Engle case. Although the Florida Supreme Court


eventually overturned certain findings that the jury in Lukacs relied upon in assessing liabilities, the


appellate court chose not to review this case. Accordingly Liggett and the two other tobacco


companies defendants have no further meaningful avenue of the field when the judgment was paid


in the second quarter.


So we’ve recently had what could be very positive news in the ruling from the Eleventh Circuit


Court of Appeals, which impacts the approximately 3,900 Engle progeny cases pending in Federal


Court. We believe the court’s ruling will likely result in severe restrictions on the ability of plaintiffs in


Federal Court to use Phase I findings determined by the prior Engle Jury to meet their burden of


proof at trial.


We agree with the industry leader that this ruling should provide persuasive authority for Florida


State Courts that have been allowing plaintiffs to rely on the Engle findings without satisfying the


requirements of Florida law or due process. We are encouraged by this recent ruling and believe it


could have a very positive impact on the future direction of the Engle cases.


Before discussing the financial results, I’m also pleased to remind you that in April 2010, we


enhanced our strong financial position by completing a private placement of an additional 75 million


of our 11% senior secured notes due 2015. Our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash


equivalents of approximately 285.5 million as of June 30, 2010. Additionally, as of June 30, 2010,


we held investment securities and partnership interests with a fair market value of approximately


143.7 million.


Now, let’s turn to the key financials for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 for


Vector Group. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, Vector Group revenues were 268.5


million compared to 206.8 million in the 2009 second quarter. The increase in revenues in 2010


was primarily due to increased volumes. The company recorded operating income of 21.1 million in


the 2010 second quarter compared to the operating income of 38.8 million in the 2009 second


quarter. Excluding the 14.4 million pre-tax charge related to litigation judgment, operating income


was 35.4 million for the quarter.


Second quarter 2010 net income was 19.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to a net loss


of 7.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the corresponding 2009 period. Excluding the charge


related to the litigation judgment and 13.8 million of pre-tax gains from changes in fair value of


derivatives embedded with our convertible debt, second quarter 2010 net income was 19.6 million


or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding 18.4 million of pre-tax charges related to be extinguishment of


debt in 2009, and 19.5 million of pre-tax charges from changes in fair value of derivatives


embedded with our convertible debt, second quarter 2009 net income was 14.7 million or $0.20 per


diluted share.


For the six months ended June 30th, 2010, Vector Group revenues were 490.6 million compared to


328 million in the first six months of 2009. The increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily due to


increased volumes and higher prices related to the federal excise tax increase, which became


effective on April 1st, 2009. The company recorded operating income of 52.1 million during the first


six months of 2010 compared to operating income of 70 million for the 2009 six month period.


Excluding the 14.4 million pre-tax charge related to the litigation judgment, operating income was


66.5 million for the six month period.
