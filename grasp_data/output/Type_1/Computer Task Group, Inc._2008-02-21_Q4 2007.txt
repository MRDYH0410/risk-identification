MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CTG Fourth Quarter


Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will


conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s conference


is being recorded, and I would like to turn the conference over to Deborah Pawlowski.


Deborah K. Pawlowski, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Shannon, and good morning everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your


interest in CTG. On the call today, we have President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt, and


Brendan Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Brendan are going


to review the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 and update you on the company’s


strategy and outlook. We’ll follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the press release


discussing our financial results, you can access it at the company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that the statements in the course of this conference call that


state the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, and predictions for


the future are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results


could differ materially from those projected. Additional information concerning factors that could


cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our


earnings release as well as in the company’s SEC filings. You can find them at our website or the


SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. So, please review our forward looking statements in conjunction


with these precautionary factors.


Now with that, I would like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this morning for our


fourth quarter conference call. As you saw on our earnings release, our fourth quarter revenue and


earnings were at the midpoint of our guidance. We are certainly pleased with the fact that before


merger evaluation cost, net income in the fourth quarter increased by 34%.


Our higher margin solutions business continues to grow causing us to be very optimistic about our


outlook for 2008. And I will talk more about our business and expectations in a minute, but first I am


going to ask Brendan to start this off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice


President


Thanks, Jim. Good morning.


For the fourth quarter of 2007, CTG’s revenues were 84.5 million, an increase of approximately 6.5


million or 8.3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. Net income of 1.2 million in the fourth


quarter of 2007 grew at a faster rate than revenue and increased by 13% from 1.1 million in the


fourth quarter of 2006. For the quarter, net income per diluted share was $0.07 and net income per


diluted share excluding equity compensation was $0.08.


These results include approximately 200,000 or $0.01 per diluted share that CTG recorded in costs


related to advisory fees incurred in connection with our consideration of two unsolicited merger

proposals from RCM Technologies Inc. As mentioned in the release, our Board unanimously


rejected both proposals. We expect an additional 200,000 in advisory fees in the first quarter as we


close out the activities associated with these proposals.


When you exclude the merger evaluation fees from our fourth quarter results, operating income


was 2.2 million, 9.5% higher than the 2006 fourth quarter. Net income excluding these fees was 1.4


million or $0.09 per diluted share, a 34% increase from 2006 fourth quarter net income. Our 2007


fourth quarter net income and net income per diluted share before both merger evaluation costs


and equity-based compensation expense was 1.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share, a 26%


increase from 1.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006.


The proportion of solutions revenue in 2007 was 32% of total revenue or 105.3 million compared


with 30% or 98.2 million in 2006. This represents 7% growth in our solutions revenue. Direct costs


as a percentage of revenue were 77.8% in the fourth quarter compared with 75.5% in the fourth


quarter of 2006 and 77.3% in the third quarter of 2007. Slightly higher direct costs were primarily


due to lower utilization of available staff.


Operating margin, excluding merger evaluation costs, was 2.6% of revenue in both the fourth


quarter of 2007 and 2006. We had 27.9 million in revenue from IBM, our largest staffing customer,


in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with 23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. This


represents 33% and 30% of total revenues in the 2007 and 2006 fourth quarters respectively. The


majority of growth in staffing was from IBM. Although they made a major cut back in the third


quarter of 2006, we did see solid improvement in this last quarter.


Quarterly revenue from our European operations was 19.8 million in the 2007 fourth quarter, a 23%


increase from the 16.1 million recorded in last year’s fourth quarter. Foreign exchange fluctuations


accounted for 12% of the 23% increase in our European revenue in the quarter. The remainder


reflects our efforts to expand in the healthcare and financial services verticals.


The tax rate for the 2007 fourth quarter was 36.5%. The tax rate for the full year 2007 was 37.6%.


The rate decreased from approximately 43% in 2006 due to the utilization of net operating loss


carryforward in 2007. The expected tax rate for 2008 is between 38 and 40%. The company had


3,400 employees at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 of which approximately 88% are billable


resources.


On the balance sheet, our days’ sales outstanding decreased to 58 days from 63 days at the end of


2006. Our days’ sales outstanding decreased from 60 days at the end of the third quarter 2007. Our


cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was approximately 600,000. We had 772,000 in


capital expenditures and recorded depreciation expense of 567,000 in the quarter. For the full year,


capital expenditures were 2.1 million and depreciation expense was 2.4 million.


During the fourth quarter of 2007, while adhering to SEC-imposed volume limitation, we


repurchased 499,000 shares of CTG common stock. The repurchases in the quarter were made at


an average price of $4.98 per share. During this most recent self-imposed blackout period prior to


releasing earnings, we repurchased shares under our 10b5-1 plan. As announced, the Board has


authorized a new 1 million share repurchase program and we plan to continue to manage our


purchases throughout the year. Jim?


James R. Boldt , Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Brendan.


Demand for staffing was somewhat inconsistent in 2007. Overall, client demand for staffing held up


as the year ended and the staffing business had a good fourth quarter. As to our solutions
