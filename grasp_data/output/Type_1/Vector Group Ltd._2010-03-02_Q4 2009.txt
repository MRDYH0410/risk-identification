MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello and welcome to Vector Group’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Earnings


Conference Call. Before the call begins, I would like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call which are not historical facts are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are

I now would like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber. You may begin.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on Vector Group’s fourth quarter and full-


year 2009 earnings conference call.


With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of Liggett Vector Brands and Liggett; and


Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call, I will provide an update on our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. Ron will then discuss the performance of Liggett Group and


Vector Tobacco for those periods, and provide his perspective on industry developments and the


competitive environment. After that, we will take your questions.


Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our company’s overall performance for 2009.


We entered 2009 recognizing that we would be facing one of the most challenging economic and


industry environments in history. However, we also entered 2009 with a well-constructed plan that


we believed would enable us to grow the share of our cigarette business despite overall industry


declines driven by the April 1 federal excise tax increase that increased industry cigarette prices by


an average of approximately 25%.


I’m pleased to report that our 2009 plan proved sound, and we were in fact able to grow our market


share by 74 basis points during the year. At the same time, we were able to increase tobacco-


related earnings exclusive of certain items that we believe to be one-time expenses. Ron will


provide more detail on this in a moment.


With respect to real estate, we continue to see positive signs in what remains a challenging market.


We are pleased that we were able to capitalize on the unique opportunity to enhance our business


at Prudential Douglas Elliman as reflected in the recent announcement of our acquisition of


Bellmarc Property Management, one of the premiere New York City property management


companies.


Before discussing the financial results, it’s worth recapping that during 2009 we further enhanced


our strong financial position by completing the private placement of $85 million of our 11% senior


secured notes due 2015; issuing 50 million of convertible notes to an affiliate of Dr. Phillip Frost,


one of our country’s most successful entrepreneurs; and exchanging and extending the maturities


of approximately 100 million of convertible notes.


In connection with the convertible-debt transactions, we recognized a pre-tax non-cash charge for


extinguishment of debt of approximately $129,000 and 18.6 million for the three and 12 months


ended December 31, 2009. In addition, due primarily to the narrowing of credit spreads in both the


US corporate credit markets and the market of the company’s debt in 2009, we recognized pre-tax

non-cash charges related to increases in the fair values of derivatives embedded within our


convertible debt of 10.1 million and 35.9 million for the three and 12 months ended December 31,


2009.


Our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $209.5 million as of


December 31, 2009. Additionally as of December 31, 2009, we held investment securities and


partnership interests with a fair market value of approximately $121.7 million.


Now, let’s turn to the key financials for the three months and full-year ended December 31, 2009,


for Vector Group. In addition to the 10.1 million of non-cash charges related to our convertible debt,


our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2009, include a pre-tax gain of 2.1


million from our investment in the St. Regis Hotel.


In addition to the 54.5 million of non-cash charges related to our convertible debt discussed


previously, our financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2009, include a pre-tax gain of


$5 million related to the 1999 trademark transaction with Philip Morris, pre-tax income of 2.1 million


related to the St. Regis Hotel, the recognition of a 6.2 million deferred tax asset associated with


Vector Tobacco’s state net operating loss carryforwards, pre-tax impairment charges of 8.5 million


on real estate, and pre-tax restructuring charges of 900,000.


Our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2008, include $583,000 of pre-tax


income from the company’s investment in the St. Regis Hotel, a gain of 16.5 million from the fair


value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt, and pre-tax impairment charges of 25.4


million on long-term investments, real estate and investment securities available for sale.


Our financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2008, include 12.6 million of pre-tax


income from the St. Regis Hotel, 24.3 million in gains from the fair value of derivatives embedded


within convertible debt, and pre-tax impairment charges of 32.4 million from long-term investments,


real estate and investment securities available for sale. I hope everyone listened to all that very


closely because we’re going to test everyone afterwards.


For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, Vector Group revenues were 236.7 million,


compared to 144.4 million in the 2008 fourth quarter. The company recorded operating income of


36.2 million in the 2009 fourth quarter, compared to operating income of 35.4 million in the 2008


fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 net income was $13.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share,


compared to 12.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the 2008 period.


Adjusting for the non-cash charges to the company’s convertible debt and gain from the investment

the year-ago period.


Excluding the non-cash charges related to the company’s convertible debt previously discussed,

restructuring charges in the 2009 period, and income from our investment in the St. Regis Hotel,
