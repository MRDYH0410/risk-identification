Thank you, Arden, and greetings for everyone. I would like to discuss some key events during this year. In fiscal year 2016, we kept a steady revenue growth and outperformed the challenging earnings guidance we've announced previously as well as cash flow despite a difficulty in macroeconomy. When we delivered the achievements, we calmly evaluated the future opportunities and the challenges and also carefully planned for the future growth. Here, we would like to discuss some achievements in the past fiscal year and the strategies in future.

Industrial automation, the soft performance was mainly because of the influence of general economic environment. During the past fiscal year, China continued adjusting its industrial structure and reducing the capacity in some industries such as petrochemical, metallurgy and building materials. However, HollySys took several strategies to mitigate the impact of market headwinds.

We gained more market share from rising industries to make up the loss from decreasing industries. We were doing well in power and chemical, which took up the largest portion of our revenue in industrial automation. We further penetrated into high-end market. For instance, we won several bids and provided DCS for supercritical coal fire-generating units such as Funeng Luoyuanwan 2X1052MW, Jiujiang Shenhua 2X1052MW, Guohua Ningdong 2X660MW and the Xinjiang TBEA 2X660MW power units.

In nuclear sector, we supplied the DCS for Hongyanhe number 5 and number 6 units. In addition, after-sale revenue was still reinforced for fiscal year 2016. With our special team kept reviewing existing customers, the demand of upgrade and the maintenance continued growth. Besides, the company has actively expanded in abroad. We signed come contracts, which delivered our own proprietary products in overseas market. In India, for example, Lanco Solar Power Polycrystalline Silicon Project will be implemented our DCS and SIS. In Indonesia, Qingshan 2X350MW coal-fire power units will use our DCS and DEH.

We will continue to win more customers and enlarge overseas business scale to support a long-term growth of IA. In factory automation sector of IA, we are changing the strategy from providing single products to providing customized turnkey solutions like what we are doing in the process control to help the customers solve their problems and satisfy their needs. We expect this sector has a good performance in the near future.

The performance of railway transportation are prominent. In high-speed rail sector, we won some contracts to provide the Train Control Centers and other related ground-based products such as Chongqing to Wanzhou Line and Xi'an to Chengdu Line. We also won several contracts in Automatic Train Protection.

In the future, according to the new five-year plan and even longer, the investment scales of the central government in high speed railway will be still sizable. At the same time, track circuit has finished the second test in June 2016. This new product could make a revenue contribution in the upcoming years.

Another strong driver of railway transportation sector for this fiscal year was subway business. We signed the contracts to provide SCADA system for Qingdao Line R3, Kunming Line 3, Chengdu Line 10, Lanzhou Line 1, Wuhan Line 8, et cetera. We will continue working closer with local subway authorities to expand our SCADA business for better marketing our subway signaling control system.

In the mechanical and electrical solution segment, although Concord and Bond are facing some difficulties like projects delayed and the depreciation of local currency, they are still working hard to expand their business. Concord, for example, signed a very large contract to provide electrical installation services for Doha Metro Phase 1. As one of the strategies to expanding the overseas market, we will ensure a healthy development of Concord and Bond and take use of the advantage of these two companies such as good customer relations and sales channel to ink more international opportunities.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Arden Xia who will review the financial results analysis on behalf of CFO, Ms. Herriet Qu.

Thank you, Mr. Shao. I would like to share some highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Comparing to the prior fiscal year, the total revenues for fiscal year 2016 increased from $531.4 million to $544.3 million, representing an increase of 2.4%.

Broken down by the revenue types, integrated contracts revenue decreased by 0.7% to $477.8 million, product sales revenue increased by 37.2% to $54.5 million, and service revenue increased by 13% to $12 million. The revenues in categories, industrial automation, $182.9 million; rail transportation, $240.3 million; mechanical and electrical solution, $95.3 million; miscellaneous, $25.8 million; total $544.3 million.

Overall gross margin, excluding non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, was 37.9% for the fiscal year 2016 as compared to 41.2% for the prior year.

The gross margin fluctuations was merely due to the different revenue mix with different margin. The GAAP overall gross margin, which includes non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles was 37.8% for the fiscal year 2016 as compared to 40.3% for the prior year. The GAAP gross margin for integrated contracts, product sales and service rendered were 35%, 56% and 66.4% for the fiscal year 2016 as compared to 37.6%, 68.4% and 61.4% for the prior year respectively.

Selling expenses were $25.6 million for fiscal year 2016, representing a decrease of $0.7 million or 2.4% compared to $26.3 million for the prior year. Presented as a percentage of total revenues, selling expenses were 4.7% and 4.9% for the fiscal year 2016 and 2015, respectively.

G&A expenses, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expenses, were $42 million for fiscal year 2016, representing a decrease of $6.3 million or 13.1%, as compared to $48.3 million for the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease of $7.4 million in bad debt provision.

The GAAP G&A expenses, which include the non-cash share-based compensation expenses, were $45.8 million and $50.8 million for the fiscal year 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The VAT refunds and government subsidies were $22.9 million for the fiscal year 2016 as compared to $30.4 million for the prior year, representing a $7.5 million or 24.7% decrease, which was primarily due to decrease of the VAT refunds of $5.5 million and the government subsidies for $2 million.

The income tax expenses and the effective tax rate were $14.2 million and 10.3% for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $26 million and 20.8% for the prior year.

At this time, we'd like to open up for Q&A session. Please note that for Chinese speaker participants, we can also do the Q&A in Mandarin and will provide translation.

Operator, please.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Patrick Xu from Nomura. Please go ahead. The line is open.

The first question is about the regular dividend for the 2016. Is there any trend right now? And then the second question is about the cash flow. And we saw last year financial report, there have no cash flow related to the dividend. And then the third question is down to the Southeast Asia performance relatively good. What kind of project or what kind of business in there and what about the cash flow circumstances? Is there any AR, account receivable or account payable related cost situation. And the fourth quarter is about the translation adjustment.

The company had no regular dividend policy in the past year, so that's why the last year cash flow financial report you couldn't see any about this. But this fiscal year, 2016, it really depends on the final decision of meeting board directors' resolutions.

[Foreign Language] (32:31-32:42).

[Foreign Language] (32:43-32:49).

[Foreign Language] (32:52-32:57).

Balance sheet [Foreign Language] (32:59).

Thank you. [Foreign Language] (33:01-33:02).

Okay. The third question is about the income in the P&L financial report, the translation adjustment. It's related to convert from the balance sheet not just for the P&L, so it will not affect the equity.

[Foreign Language] (33:31-33:51).

In the Southeast Asia with our business including the M&E part and besides that, we also provide our own products, like rail and the industrial automation.

And also, for example, like the industrial automation, we have two direction. One is EPC project like the Qingshan project about the coal-fired station in Indonesia, and also like the second direction is the local sales. We already set up the local team to sell our products like the project in India, land coal project.

And the correlated cash flow is turned to – is also very health. And we have no any problem with the situation.

Patrick?

[Foreign Language] (35:39-35:41).

Thank you. Operator, next one, please.

Your next question comes from Kevin Luo from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. The line is open.

Hi, Kevin.

I have three questions. The first one is, why did the VAT refunds and government subsidies decrease by 25% in fiscal year 2016? And my second question is, why did – we find that our earnings contribution from the equity investment turned around and contributed $80 million in fiscal year 2016. Can you explain why? The third question is we find that the company's effective income tax rate dropped by only 10% in fiscal year 2016. Will this be sustainable in fiscal year 2017 and future? Thank you.

And the first question is about the VAT refund and subsidy decline, and this fiscal year compared last fiscal year goes down. And the first is down to the VAT. VAT goes down is because we have a one-time discount for the railway contract in [indiscernible] (39:04) this fiscal year. So we pay less tax, and then we get less refund. That's the reason for the VAT. And the subsidy is also in the health range of up and down. So it's got cheaper in future.

And the government subsidy is really related to the final close of the project. This not means we get a lagged subsidy. Just this fiscal year, we have lagged projects. We do have implementing projects not finished yet. So, that's why not got this final subsidy.

The second question about the share of net income of equity invest fees, these parts represent the company of China technology corporation. And in the past, the first reason is they got to us a government subsidy around the CNY 88 million versus the 40% of our shares. We get around CNY 38 million. Besides, their performance turns to positive this fiscal year. You can see in the financial report in the past years that part is loss. But this fiscal year, it turns to gain. That's why represented the strategy, we've received $7.8 million increase from this part.

The third question is about the tax. This fiscal year we get a certificate of a key software enterprise, and that this is a release that HollySys have financed and passed with the No. 49 Article of Tax of Software and the Integrated Circuit Industry. Actually, that part we just paid 10% of the income tax versus 15% as before. And this part renew each year, and we believe we could continue to get the license.

[Foreign Language] (43:24-43:26).

Operator, next one.

Your next question comes from Alex Chang from Citigroup. Please ask your question. The line is open.

[Foreign Language] (43:43).

Hi, Alex.

Hi.

[Foreign Language] (43:46-44:29).

Hello, operator? Alex?

Sorry. Pardon the interruption. The line has disconnected, the line of the participant. If you wish, I can take out...

Okay. No problem. We can wait in for the reconnect. And I will translate to the first question right now. The first question from Alex is about the – please share the information about the gross margin in each category within IA, rail, M&E and also what's the trend in the next fiscal year, 2017. And maybe we could answer the first question right now. [Foreign Language] (45:23-45:25).

[Foreign Language] (45:29-46:23). Okay. About the gross margin, in last fiscal year, the fourth quarter, we already said, for the gross margin, we have different mix of different product and also the structure right now is changing. That's why these two main factors account for different gross margin, and also the influence. And so, we believe the next fiscal year just like this fiscal year that the gross margin will depend on the different product mix and also different revenue structure. Currently, the IA is still okay and the rail, M&E is still in the range of what we said. So we'll keep the gross margin in the next fiscal year.

Hi, Alex.

[Foreign Language] (47:23).

Okay. [Foreign Language] (47:26-47:32).

[Foreign Language] (47:34-48:24). The second question is about – we saw the guidance for the next fiscal year is the same as before. But just like this fiscal year 2016, the net income is performing very good. So could you break down the number that which part contributed to net income? And also in future, the three segments, IA, rail, M&E, what about their performance or price mix or performance in future. And also what about the control of the expenditure in future?

[Foreign Language] (49:09-51:52:). The breaking down in future, the IA will – our target in the fiscal year 2017 will be flat. This is because one is from the factory automation that we will focus on the intelligent turnkey solution and also have the overseas revenue contribution. We will continue to expand oversea market.

And also, in domestic areas, the market currently seems – not goes down anymore. And from the new order side, this fiscal year turns to good than last fiscal year. For example, last fiscal year, each quarter had more than 30% decline, but this fiscal year turns to flat. And besides, the revenue structure is changing. After-sale is increasing. So the IA, our target is to be flat for the next fiscal year.

And the railway transportation, because the subway side, we continue expanding the SCADA business. And, also, we have potential chance to get the this subway signal in the new product, the CBTC and the high-speed rail [indiscernible] (53:08). Everything is ready and we will get the contract. So that's why for railway transportation, generally speaking, for the next fiscal year, we will achieve, at least, a 5% to 10% revenue growth.

And last one is the M&E segment because we already got a very large contract, $16 million, so that is to say in the next fiscal year, this part will achieve a very good performance. So, we will try our best to achieve growth as we can.

And from the gross margin side, because after-sale revenue, for example, is increasing and also, we can show the expenditure from the marketing, sales, selling, everything, that part that will keep the same at this fiscal year. And also, the R&D expenditure will keep everything. This will not affect any operating expenditure. And also, we can show the data per region and the effective tax rate we'll keep roughly lower and we'll continue to do that.

[Foreign Language] (54:27-54:40).

[Foreign Language] (54:41-54:43), Alex.

[Foreign Language] (54:45-54:45).

The question is about, could you please tell us the size of the contract for the track circuit and the CBTC system or any planning for the fiscal year 2017? The answer is we have no – we cannot disclose the timeline currently. And maybe when we have the first contract, we'll have better to give you landscape about the process side in future.

With the time constraint, the last question, please, operator? Hello, operator? Please?

Your next question comes from Bo Yong Liu from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.

Thank you. The first question is about the first quarter, the results from the high-speed rail seems performed very strong. But last calendar year, we got the contract and it seems like it's already [indiscernible] (56:51) in the last quarter and also the gross margin is still very high, above 45%. So could you explain where it's from?

And the second part is about the effective tax rate. Is it possible that we can, just to calculate, the effective tax rate is 10% in the next fiscal year?

[Foreign Language] (57:13-57:37). The rail, just the high-speed rail for this quarter is because we have implemented the – we based on percentage of completion, the ATP contract would be [indiscernible] (57:54) in nine months to 12 months. So, actually this quarter, we still have the ATP contracts. Besides, the gross margin is relatively high because we gather the supplement of the ATP project. So, not just this quarter and even the next quarter, we still have ATP on hand. So, that's why not – either from the revenue and the gross margin, the high-speed rail is still very strong.

And the second question about the effective tax rate, about the effective tax rate, it's better not to calculate to just 10% because 10% is just implemented within two companies in Beijing, and the other company's subsidy raises in China still implemented. Some of them are around 15% and some of them are still 25%. And abroad, the subsidy raises, they implemented effective tax rates currently in the 17%.

So it's better to calculate at the comprehensive and also depends on the revenue structure. So, we think it's gone around the 13% from the effective tax rate and also like the same for the next fiscal year.

[Foreign Language] (59:59-01:00:00).

[Foreign Language] (01:00:00-01:00:01) Bo Yong.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise your questions, we will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We look forward to speaking with you again in the near future. Thank you. [Foreign Language] (01:00:17)

[Foreign Language] (01:00:18)

[Foreign Language] (01:00:18)

That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.
