MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the CTG Fourth Quarter


Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a


question and answer session giving instructions at that time. If you should require assistance


during this call, please press * and then 0. And as a reminder today's conference is being


recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, James Boldt. Please go ahead.


James R. Boldt, Chairman, President


Good morning everyone, this is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this morning for our


Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are CFO, Gregory Dearlove. As to the


format of the call this morning, Greg is going to begin the review of our financial results if there is a


review, I'll talk about the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter as well as what we anticipate for


the first quarter of 2005 and then we'll open the call for questions. Greg, if you could start us off


please.


Gregory M. Dearlove, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you Jim and good morning. Before we begin and I want to mention that statement made in


the course of this conference call that state the company's or management's intentions, hopes


beliefs, expectations or predictions in the future of our forward looking statements. It's important to


note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected. Additional


information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward


looking statements is contained in our press releases and from time to time in the company's SEC


filings.


For the fourth quarter of 2004 CTG's revenues from continuing operations were $58.8 million. Net


income from continuing operations were $900,000 and net income per diluted shares was 5 cents.


Our fourth quarter revenues were in line with our expectations. Our net income from continuing


operations slightly exceeded our expectations for reasons I will address. Our direct profit


percentage increased to 27.9% in the fourth quarter, up about 2 percentage points from the fourth


quarter last year. And our operating income decreased from 2.3% last year to 3/10th of a percent


in the fourth quarter this year.


Excluding the impact of our accounting change in 2002, this is the 14th consecutive quarter that the


company has reported net income from continuing operations. SG&A increased over $622,000 in


the fourth quarter versus the same quarter last year and approximated 27.6% of revenue. An


increase of about 2.3 percentage points from last year. For both the quarter and the year in total


the company had a net tax benefit. For the year the company had a number of favorable tax


adjustments including being able to recognize approximately $500,000 in previously reserved


foreign net income loss benefits. We were also able due to changing tax legislation in Europe to


release approximately $600,000 in previously reserved tax liabilities.


At year end, the company also adapted a tax strategy through the combination of subsidiaries


which allowed for the recognition of approximately $400,000 in state net operating loss benefits,


which were previously fully reserved. And finally, we had approximately $200,000 in various net


deferred tax liabilities which were determined to be no longer required and were released.


Approximately $800,000 of these matters were determined during the fourth quarter which


combined with operating income resulted in a $900,000 tax benefit in the quarter. The company

also has a number of formula based incentive plans, which are driven off EPS. The favorable tax


benefits realized in the fourth quarter caused us to accrue for these incentives. If we had not had


these favorable tax benefits, we would have not accrued for these incentives and SG&A would


have approximated the fourth quarter of 2003. Operating income would have been approximately


1.3% and fully diluted earnings per share would have been about 2 cents from continuing


operations.


Other news from IBM were 20 or 12.8 million or 20 – or $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004


as compared to $12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Quarterly revenues from our European


operations were $12.1 million in 2004 as compared to $9.2 million in the last year's fourth quarter.


On the balance sheet our days sales outstanding and receivables increased to 72 days from 63


days in the fourth quarter of 2003, but it's down from 74 days in the third quarter of 2004. Long-term


debt was just under $4.7 million at quarter-end, which ended on a payroll date. This is up from


having no debt at year-end in 2003 and up slightly from the $4.5 million at the end of the third


quarter of 2004, both of which fell on payroll periods – between payroll periods, excuse me.


Our cash flows will reflect an increase in cash during the quarter of approximately $745,000. We


made $347,000 in capital acquisitions and recorded depreciation expense of $527,000. Also, total


employment in the fourth quarter was 2,500, of which approximately 85% are billable employees.


Regarding or review of internal controls and procedures in connection with Section 404 of the


Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is in the process of completing our internal assessment


over controls of financial accounting and reporting. We do plan to report on one matter, which we


identified during the fourth quarter to be the material weakness in internal controls. Although


properly, certain controls related to income tax accounting, specifically related to deferred taxes


failed due to human error. The resulting errors, which were recorded and which were not material


to the financial results, could have materially impacted our results. To address this weakness, the


company is increasing the role of an outside tax consultant engaged to enhance our review


process, and we will strengthen our internal tax capabilities. Jim, that concludes my summary of


the company's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2004.


James Boldt, CEO


Thanks, Greg. As you know our fourth quarter revenues were pretty much what we expected. As


we mentioned on our third quarter conference call we had 62 billing days in the fourth quarter of


2004, versus 66 billing days in the fourth quarter of 2003. If you look at our revenues on a daily


basis, our revenues actually increased by 2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 and 3%


sequentially. While there are several areas that contributed to the increase, most of the gains


came from our staffing business. The gains that were seen in the staffing business are expected to


accelerate in the first quarter of 2005, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.


Our Healthcare Group had a good 2004, and particularly benefited from 2 new large, multi-year


implementation engagements. Our healthcare business continues to grow, and we expect to see


its revenues increase at a double-digit rate in 2005. Our Life Sciences vertical also had a good


2004. We continue to add new customers to that business and believe they too should have a


good 2005.


Revenue from our financial services vertical declined in 2004 due to the multi-year projects that


ended last year. We've introduced new offerings into our financial services vertical and we expect


that it will improve in 2005.


As you know, we sold our Netherlands operating company in early 2004. Now that the Dutch


operations have been divested, our European region is growing and profitable again. We see a lot


of opportunity in Europe at the moment.
