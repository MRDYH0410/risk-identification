MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to the GSE Systems Incorporated Third Quarter 2010 Earnings


Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference


over to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jim Eberle. Please go ahead, sir.


James A. Eberle, Chief Executive and Operating Officer


Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to GSE’s 2010 third quarter conference call. I’m


Jim Eberle, GSE’s Chief Executive Officer. I’m joined here today with our Chief Financial Officer,


Jeff Hough.


As most of you’re aware GSE historically has hosted a year-end and a mid-year conference call


since this is the company’s first quarterly financial reporting since I became CEO. I wanted to make


an exception to our two call per year format and speak with everyone today.


Today’s call will begin with a brief overview of our third quarter financial results. This will be


followed by an overview of several significant new contract win since our last call, then an update


on our recent acquisition of TAS Holdings. I would then like to share with you some of my near and


longer-term goals for the company as well as share some general insights into what I would call


strategic initiatives that the company will be undertaking in order to expand our presence in several


of our existing markets as well as pursuing new opportunities. But before we begin, I’d like to turn it


over to Jeff to address the subject of forward-looking statements.


Jeffery G. Hough, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and


Senior Vice President


Thanks. This presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding the future performance of


GSE Systems, Inc. that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially, including but not limited to economic conditions, customer demand, increased


competition in the relevant market and others.


We refer you to the documents that the company files from time to time with the Securities and


Exchange Commission, which is the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports, which contain


additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ from its current expectations


and from the forward-looking statements made in this presentation.


James A. Eberle, Chief Executive and Operating Officer


Thank you, Jeff. Before I report our financial results for the third quarter, I would like to convey how


excited I’m to lead GSE through the company’s next phase of growth. I’m happy to be able to bring


the knowledge and experience in the nuclear power I obtained in the United States Navy, as well as


the adult for-profit training and education business from my 14 years at General Physics


Corporation.


I’m also happy to report that since joining GSE five months ago, I found a solid company full of


brilliant, talented and dedicated professionals. We have many opportunities to grow both


organically and via acquisition and by leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, I have every


confidence that we will grow and grow significantly.

And now on to our third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release today, we reported


revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2010 of $11.9 million, that’s a 16.5% increase


from the revenue reported for the three months ended September 30, 2009, up $10.2 million.


Included in the revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was 3.6 million of revenue


from our $23.8 million contract to provide a new nuclear power plant operator training simulator to a


Slovak power plant. This contract includes approximately $16.4 million of hardware, the largest


portion being a Siemens digital control system. The company accrues the cost of the digital control


system based upon its estimate of the work completed by Siemens. As the purchase price of the


digital control system is denominated in euro, we must remeasure the approved price – excuse me,


the accrued cost into U.S. dollars each quarter based upon the quarter end exchange rate.


For the three-months ended September 30, 2010, the company recognized an unrealized currency


loss of $506,000 on the accrued cost of this system, which was recorded in the cost of revenue.


Excluding the currency impact, gross profit percentage would have been 24.4% for the three


months ended September 30, 2010, versus 24.5% for the three months ended September 30,


2009.


We had an operating loss of $328,000 for the third quarter of 2010, as compared to operating


income of 428,000 in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the currency impact, the company would


have had an operating profit of $178,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2010, as


compared to an operating income of 381,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2009. Our


net loss for the third quarter of 2010 was $548,000 or $0.03 per share on both the basic and diluted


basis, as compared to net income of $458,000 or $0.03 per share on both the basic and diluted


basis for the third quarter of 2009. Our revenue for the nine-months ended September 30, 2010,


was $34.9 million, a 20.3% increase from the revenue reported for the nine-months ended


September 30, 2009 of 29 million.


For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the company generated $25.3 million or 74% of


our total revenue from nuclear simulation, $7.5 million or 21% of our total revenue from non-nuclear


simulation, 2.1 million or 5% of total revenue from the training and engineering consulting services


sector.


Our operating income was 877,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as compared


with an operating income of 1,617,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. We


generated net income of 271,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 or $0.01 per


share on both the basic and diluted basis, compared to net income of 1,362,000 or $0.08 per share


on both the basic and diluted basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.


During the first nine months of the year, we had no borrowings against our revolving lines of credit


with Bank of America, volumes are being used to collateralize standby letters of credit, which have


been issued to customers as performance bonds. At September 30, 2010, our available borrowing


base under the lines of credit was $4.1 million. The company’s cash balance at September 30,


2010 was $33.8 million and after making payments of just over $8.5 million to our subcontractor on


our Slovakian nuclear power plant contract, our current cash balance is approximately $24 million.


GSE, as most of you know, periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage


market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign


denominated trade receivables. Again, the purpose and structure of the foreign exchange contracts


that GSE has entered into are designed to protect the contract value and margins at the time the


contracts are signed and not designed to speculate on the direction of any currency up or down.


Keep in mind that the gain or loss reported due to these contracts will net out to zero at the time the


contract expires. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, the company incurred a


$47,000 pre-tax non-cash gain on its foreign exchange contracts. For the nine months ended
