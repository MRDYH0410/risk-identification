MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Encore Wire Second Quarter Earnings Call. As a


reminder all lines will be on listen-only mode and there will be a Q&A session at the end of the call.


[Operator Instructions].


At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, President, so that we may begin


our call. Go ahead please, Mr. Jones.


Daniel L. Jones, Chief Executive Officer and President


Okay. Thank you, Rainee. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly earnings conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief


Executive Officer of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer.


We continue to announce earnings in the midst of a tough competitive environment and our


industry in the slump in the overall U.S. economy. And we certainly want to produce more profit


than we currently are. Our results must be viewed in the context of the current economic and


industry conditions. The slowdown in construction activity in the United States continues to impact


our industry adversely as it has over the last three years.


Our unit volume shipped in the second quarter of 2009 decreased 9% versus the first quarter of


2009. It should be noted that this 9% sequential unit decline compares to the first quarter of 2009,


during which we had a 9% sequential increase in units versus the fourth quarter of 2008.


The current financial crisis has raised uncertainty amongst builders across America. Uncertainty


has also affected our competitors and created a volatile pricing environment in our industry that we


compressed – that was actually compressed the spread between what we paid for a pound of


copper versus what we’re able to charge for wire that contained a pound of copper.


In the second quarter of 2009, the spread fell by 9.4% versus the second quarter of 2008, and it fell


by 5.1% versus the first quarter of 2009. We attempted to lead and support the industry with


several price increases during the quarter, but met limited success as the average price of wire sold


increased only 21% while the copper cost increased 34% on a sequential quarter basis.


Our reps in the field also tell us that the volatility of copper over the last year coupled with declining


industry volumes has caused many of our distributor customers to lean down their inventory levels.


The low inventory levels in the distribution chain makes Encore’s excellent order fill rates valuable


to customers who are gravitating towards a just-in-time inventory.


We believe our volume decreases are less than the total industry, we believe that we’re able to get


a slight premium for our excellent service level from customers who realize they’re saving money


by buying from us.


Making a profit in this economy is an impressive accomplishment and we thank our employees and


associates for their tremendous efforts. We thank our shareholders for their continued support.


And Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer, will now discuss our financial results. Frank?


Frank J. Bilban, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute, we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we will take any questions you may have.

Each of you should have received a copy of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial


results. This release is available on the Internet or you can call Denise List at 800-962-9473 and we


will get you a copy.


Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in these initial comments and in the question-


and-answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation, and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements


involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more


detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this conference call to the


most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including


EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information for investors are posted on


www.encorewire.com.


Now, for the financial results. Net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, were $159.4


million compared to 322.8 million during the second quarter of 2008. Lower prices for building wires


sold in the quarter ended June 30, 2009 accounted for most of the decrease in net sales dollars,


declining 38.1% per copper pound sold versus the same period in 2008.


Unit sales in the second quarter of 2009 decreased 20.2% versus the second quarter of 2008.


Sales prices fell primarily due to lower copper prices and building wire industry competition.


Net income for the second quarter of 2009 was $600,000 versus $1.3 million in the second quarter


of 2008. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.03 in the second quarter of 2009


versus $0.06 in the second quarter of 2008.


Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were $303.8 million compared to $604.6 million


during the same period in 2008. Again, lower prices for building wire sold in the six months ended


June 30, 2009 accounted for most of the decrease in net sales dollars, declining 42.6% versus the


same period in 2008. Unit volume in the six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased 12.4% versus


the same period in 2008.


Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $5.2 million versus $15 million in the same


period in 2008. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.22 for the six months ended


June 30, 2009 versus $0.64 in the same period in 2008.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the second quarter of 2009 were $159.4 million


versus $144.5 million during the first quarter of 2009. Unit volume decreased 9% on a sequential


quarter comparison.


Net income for the second quarter of 2009 was $600,000 versus $4.6 million in the first quarter of


2009. Fully diluted net income per common share was $0.03 in the second quarter of ‘09 versus


$0.20 in the first quarter of ‘09.


As usual, the real story behind our earnings fluctuation is in the spread between what we paid for a


pound of copper versus what we were able to charge for wire that contained a pound of copper. As


Daniel highlighted earlier, our spreads were down year-over-year and also on a sequential quarterly


comparison.


Informed investors who had followed us for some time and understand the dynamics of our


business have focused on the spread as the key driver of our earnings and also understand that
