MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Please stand by. Good day and welcome to the Southwestern Energy Company


Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Conference. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to


President, Chairman, and CEO, Mr. Harold Korell. Please go ahead.


Harold M. Korell, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Richard Lane, our Executive Vice


President of our E&P Company and Greg Kerley, our Chief Financial Officer.


If you have not received a copy of the press releases we announced yesterday, you can call Annie


at (281) 618-4784 and she will fax a copy to you. Also, I would like to point out that many of the


comments during this teleconference may be regarded as forward-looking statements that involve


risks and uncertainties that are detailed in our Securities and Exchange Commission Filings. We


also would warn you that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties,


many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based


on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or


developments may differ materially.


Well, to begin with, things have gone pretty well for us during the first six months of 2005.


Yesterday, we reported earnings for the second quarter of a record $26.8 million, up 29% from the


same period last year. Our cash flow for the second quarter was also up 29% from a year ago to a


record 65.1 million. These results have been primarily driven by the current commodity price


environment and by the strong growth in our production volumes. In our E&P program, we


continue to have excellent drilling results at our Overton Field in East Texas and the Ranger


Anticline in the Arkoma Basin.


In the Fayetteville Shale Play, we have made progress in our understanding of horizontal wells,


established production in six pilot areas, are now drilling in a seventh pilot, and are completing a


well in the eighth pilot area. In addition, we have obtained field rules for three fields in total and are


now producing at a gross daily rate of approximately 10 million cubic feet per day.


As we announced yesterday, we are preparing to accelerate our drilling program in the Fayetteville


Shale. In addition to the purchase of new drilling rigs for the Play, we have increased our capital


program for the Fayetteville Shale from approximately $100 million to $127 million for 2005 to fund


our drilling program and to continue our leasing efforts. We now plan to drill 80 to 90 wells in 2005


in the Fayetteville Shale Play, with approximately 50 of these wells being horizontal. We also plan


to increase our drilling activity at Overton, our other East Texas areas at the Ranger Anticline, and


in the Permian Basin. Richard will talk more about the capital plan and give an update on our E&P


operations in a moment.


Overall, I am very pleased with what we have accomplished to date and look forward to what lies


ahead for us in 2005 and beyond. I will now turn the teleconference over to Richard Lane who will


tell you more about our E&P results and then to Greg Kerley to discuss our financial results and


then we will answer questions.


Richard F. Lane, Executive Vice President, Southwestern Energy Production Company &


SEECO, Inc.


Thank you Harold and good morning. Production for the second quarter was 15 Bcfe, up 19% from


the 12.6 we produced in the second quarter of 2004 and up 7% from the 14 we produced in the first

quarter of this year. Of the 15 Bcfe of second quarter production, 6.5 was from East Texas, 5.2


from our conventional Arkoma Basin properties, 1.8 from the Permian Basin, 1.1 from the Gulf


Coast, and 0.4 from our Fayetteville Shale Play.


Production during the second quarter of 2005 included the continued effects of curtailment of


production at our Overton Field. This curtailment issue was resolved late in the quarter and current


gross production from Overton is approximately 100 million cubic feet per day as compared to


about 80 to 90 million cubic feet per day while we were being curtailed.


We continue to be very active in East Texas and in the Arkoma Basin, particularly in our Ranger


Anticline Field and our Fayetteville Shale Play. Year-to-date we have spudded a total of 119 wells,


including 43 wells in East Texas, 22 wells at Ranger, and 30 wells in our Fayetteville Shale Play.


We currently have 6 rigs running in East Texas, 4 at Ranger, and 3 in the Fayetteville Shale and


expect to increase our Fayetteville Shale rig count through the remainder of the year.


As a result of strong E&P revenues and our high inventory of high PVI drilling projects, we have


increased our E&P 2005 capital budget from 339 million to $425 million. This $86 million increase


includes 27 million for additional drilling in land in the Fayetteville Shale Play, 15.5 million for East


Texas drilling, 5.6 million for Ranger Anticline, and $4.2 million for the Permian Basin. The


remaining $33.8 million is for the purchase of five new land drilling rigs plus associated equipment


that we announced at the beginning of July.


Moving to our Shale Play, in the first half of 2005, we invested approximately $55.3 million in the


Play including 33.3 million to drill 30 wells and 19.1 million for leasehold acquisitions.


As of June 30


th


, we held approximately 690,000 net acres in the undeveloped Play area. In


addition, we control approximately 125,000 net developed acres in the traditional Fairway area of


the basin. Since beginning our drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale in 2004, we have drilled a


total of 50 wells and participated in one outside operated well. The wells are located in eight


separate pilot areas located in Franklin, Conway, Van Buren, Cleburne and Faulkner counties in


Arkansas.


In an East West direction, we have drilled wells and established production approximately 40 miles


apart and in a North South direction 15 miles apart. Of the 51 wells, 41 are producing, 6 are in


some stage of completion or waiting on pipeline hookup, and 4 are shut-in due to marginal


performance.


To date, we have drilled 9 horizontal wells in 4 separate pilot areas. Of the 9 horizontal wells, 7


have been completed and 2 are waiting on completion. Since our last press release on June 28th,


the Coon #2-34 horizontal well located in our Gravel Hill Field was placed on production at


approximately 1.7 million cubic feet per day.


In addition the Hall #1-12 horizontal well located in our Brookie pilot area was production tested last


week at 2.8 million cubic feet per day and the Black 2-17 horizontal well in our Scotland Field


recently tested at 2.9 million cubic feet per day. The initial test rates for the completed horizontal


wells has ranged from 1.4 to 3.7 million cubic feet per day, excluding our Vaughan #4-22-H well


where we encountered well bore problems and had a limited stimulation treatment. Two of these


wells, the Stobaugh #2-1-H and the McNew #3-2-H which have been on production for more than


30 days have an average first month production rate of 2.2 million cubic feet per day.


Based on these production histories and our modeling work, we believe the average ultimate


production from these horizontal wells will be between 1.3 and 1.7 Bcfe per well. We expect our


yearend reserve assessment for our horizontal wells to be composed of both proved and probable


reserves as we have limited production histories for these wells.
