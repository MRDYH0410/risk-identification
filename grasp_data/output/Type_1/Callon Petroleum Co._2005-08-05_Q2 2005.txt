MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Callon Petroleum


Company second quarter results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn


the conference over to Mr. Fred, Callon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead,


sir.


Fred Callon, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning and thank you for taking the time to join our second quarter conference


call. Before we begin the formal portion of our presentation this morning, I'd like to take a few


moments to remember John Weatherly, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who


passed away just two days after our last conference call. We sincerely appreciate the many kind


words and expressions of sympathy and concern. As you all know, John enjoyed this interaction


and working with all of you. There's not enough time this morning to adequately describe the


tremendous John had on the success of our company. John was brilliant; his financial acumen was


legendary around here. In his 25 years with the company, John helped lead well over $0.5 billion in


financing transactions for our company. In addition, he was a great leader during some very


difficult times. Using his dry wit, with his great financial savvy.


So on a personal, John has two wonderful daughters who are doing well; Christina [ph] and her


fiance, William, are getting married this month and Jenny [ph] and her husband, Josh, are headed


back to school. They're – Jenny is a second year medical student at Chapel Hill so, we wish them


all the best.


Fortunately, for us, John developed a strong management team; reporting to him and they have


stepped up and taken on additional responsibility. With the great job they're doing, we don't have


immediate pressure to get from one end to cover the pay-day operations, however, we are in the


process of evaluating the job description and role there we need to try to help us to fill that void.


But as I said, fortunately right now we've got a strong team that has stepped up and things are


running smoothly.


With that, I'd like to ask Terry Trovato, who heads our Investor Relations, to make a few of his


opening comments.


Terry Trovato, Investor Relations


Thank you, Fred. We'd like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this


teleconference will be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of


the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. These comments, which include a discussion of the


company's financial position, reserve estimates and business strategy reflect the management's


views as of this date, though assurance can't be given that these events will occur or that the


projections will be attained.


There are a variety of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the company's


expectations. Many of these factors are identified under Risk Management or Risk Factors in


Callon's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange


Commission. All forward-looking statements attributable to the company are expressly qualified by


these factors. Fred?

Fred Callon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Terry. We're going to begin with a discussion of results of operations for the 3 months


and 6 months ended June 30. Then I'd like to take you through some operations update and then


we'll cover guidance and then we'll open things up for questions. So beginning for the second


quarter of 2005, we reported net income of $9.3 million or 46 cents a share on a diluted basis. This


compares to consents of final assessments of 43 cents a share. Net income would have been 49


cents had it not been for a one-time unanticipated non-cash G&A charge of 3 cents a share. I'll


explain that in a moment. For the six-month period ended June 30th, we reported net income of


$18.8 million or 92 cents a share on a diluted basis. For the same period last year we reported net


income of $11.8 million or 75 cents a share on a diluted basis.


As it was discussed last quarter, at year-end 2003 we were required under FFAS 109 to impair the


book value of our differed tax asset, even though we fully expected to utilize the underlying carry


forwards in the following years. The offsetting impact was that earnings for the first three months of


'04 were not produced by normal tax provisions. At year-end 2004, the remaining value of the


deferred tax asset was reinstated and it was resolved. Quarterly earnings for this year are reduced


by a normal tax provision.


Pre-tax earnings provide a more comparable gauge of the improvement scene in the second


quarter of '05 and the six month ended June 30, 2005. You look at pre-tax earnings for the second


quarter of 2005; they were 69 cents a share, compared to 58 cents for the second quarter of last


year. Pre-tax earnings for the first six months of this year were $1.38 per share compared to 75


cents a share in the period last year. Oil and gas sales for the second quarter 2005 totaled $41.7


million compared to $37.6 million in the second quarter of 2004. For the six-month period into June


30, 2005, oil and gas sales were $84.7 million, up by 22% from $69.5 million in the same period last


year. This increase is due primarily to price.


Production for the second quarter 2005 was 590,000 barrels and 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas


or 64 million cubic feet of equivalent per day, which was near the point of our guidance. Production


for the six-month period ended June 30th, averaged 69 million cubic feet equivalent a day, average


rollouts of 5 cents for the second quarter of 2005 were $41.53 per barrel representing a substantial


improvement over the $30.03 for the same quarter last year. The benchmark oil price marked by


the average closing price of NYMEX contracts for deliver of WTI averaged $53.17 a barrel.


Average oil prices for the six-month period ended June 30th, were $39.41 a barrel, compared to the


benchmark oil price of $51.51 a barrel.


As previously discussed in the last conference call, the spread between the benchmark oil price


and our average oil prices do follow the adjustments in the sale of our production from Medusa and


Habanero. Approximately 65% of our oil production, both three months and six month period into


June 30th, or from Medusa which is hold as Morris-Blinn, second quarter 2005 Morris-Blinn


averaged $44.12 a barrel, a $6.41 per barrel discount to WTI. From the six-month period into June


30, 2005, Morris-Blinn averaged $42.65, a $6.84 a barrel discount to WTI. Approximately 26% of


our oil production for the three-month and six months into June 30, 2005, was from Habanero, who


just sold as Paneta's File [ph]. Second quarter 2005 Paneta's File [ph] averaged $46.66, or a $3.22


per barrel discount to WTI. And during the six month period ended June 30, 2005, Paneta's File


[ph] averaged $45.22 per barrel, a $3.52 per barrel discount to WTI.


In addition to these quality adjustments previously established crude oil hedging positions reduced


our average realized oil price by $2.99 and $3.91 per barrel for the 3-month and 6-month period


ended June 30, 2005 respectively. Natural gas price realizations averaged $7.43 per NCF for the


second quarter of 2005, an increase of 18% over the same quarter last year and $7.15 for the six


month period ended June 30, 2005, a 17% increase over the prior year. As was the case in the


first quarter, these prices are still ahead of the closing NYMEX contract prices for Henry Hut gas


deliveries, previously established natural gas hedging positions increased our average realized
