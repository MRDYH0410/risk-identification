MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


<Operator:> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BSQUARE Fourth Quarter


and Year-End conference call. [operator instructions] I would like to the turn the conference over to


Mr. Scott Mahan, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir.


Scott Mahan Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer


Good afternoon and welcome to our conference call. With me today is Brian Crowley, our CEO.


Before we begin let me remind you that this call is being recorded and broadcast live over the year


and that a recording of this call will be archived on our website at bsquare.com. Let me also remind


you that expect for this historical statements and information contained herein matters discussed in


this call, including any revenue and net income expectation and comments regarding our product


and other growth initiatives are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.


Factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially include by are not limited to a decline


in the market for Windows-based or other smart devices or the failure of such market to develop as


anticipated; adverse changes in macro-economic conditions; a decline in the market for our


products technology licenses and services; our ability to successfully implement, execute and make


adjustments in our business strategy, business model or product offerings; lack of customer


acceptance of new products or initiatives; risks associated with the effects of our restructurings; our


ability to successfully support our operations; competition; and intellectual property risks.


A more detailed description of certain factors that could affect our actual results include but are not


limited to those discussed in BSQUARE’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended


December 31, 2003 in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and in our subsequent Quarterly Reports


on Form 10-Q. Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking


statements, which speak only as of the date of this conference call. BSQUARE undertakes no


obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events or


circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.


With that said, I will now turn to discussion of our results.


Let me start with topline. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was 8.9 million, compared to 10.7


million in the fourth quarter of 2003, and 10.6 million in the third quarter of ‘04. As you've seen in


our public filings, we report two revenue lines, software and service. I will speak to trends in each


of that. Software revenue in the fourth quarter was 6.5 million or 73% of total revenue as compared


to compared to 8.6 million in the fourth quarter of '03 and 8.1 million in the third quarter of ‘04, a


decline of 2.1 million and 1.6 million, respectively.


Software revenue consists of two components. First, the majority comes from the sale of what we


refer to as third-party software. Primarily Microsoft embedded operating systems. The second


component is BSQUARE’s own proprietary software. Third-party software revenue was 5.8 million


in the fourth quarter or 89% of total software revenue, compared to 7.8 million in the fourth quarter


of ’03 and 7.5 million in the third quarter of '04. Virtually the entire revenue shortfall this quarter is


stand from the decline in third-party software sales. This decline was in turn largely due to lower


than anticipated order volumes from our largest customer, Cardinal Healthcare, which managed


inventory levels down unexpectedly.


Cardinal represented 19% and 17% of total revenue for the years ended 2004 and 2003,


respectively, as investors saw in this most recent quarter, Cardinal's ordering patterns can cost


quite significant swings in our revenue. We do expect Cardinal to return to normal ordering pattern


late in Q1. This fact coupled with the 20% sequential increase in sales of Microsoft embedded


toolkits, lead us to expect sales of third party software to rebound in Q1. We had another strong


quarter and sales of BSQUARE proprietary products. BSQUARE software products contributed

680,000 of revenue in the fourth quarter or 11% of software revenue as compared to 796,000 and


635,000 in the fourth quarter of '03 and third quarter of '04 respectively.


Sales were strong even as sales of SDIO now declined in the quarter as expected. Sales of SDIO


now were 357,000 and 443,000 in the fourth quarters of '04 and '03 respectively and 578,000 in the


third quarter of 2004. We generated 320,000 in non-SDIO BSQUARE software sales during the


quarter. We saw a purchase of our SmartBuild reference design in the amount of 180,000 from a


military contractor we worked with previously. We expect future purchases from this customer,


likely not in Q1. Our SmartBuild reference design demonstrates the type of opportunities on which


we plan to capitalize in 2005. Software revenue for the full year 2004 was 28.4 million, including


25.7 million in the third party software sales and 1.8 million in sales of SDIO now. This compared


to software revenue of 28.2 million for the full year of 2003, which included 25.2 million in the third


party software sales and 1.6 million in sales of SDIO now.


Sales to third party software were relatively flat year-over-year because of two soft quarters in


2004, driven by ordering levels from Cardinal Healthcare. The other significant component of


revenue is service revenue. Service revenue for the quarter was 2.4 million or 24% – 27% of total


revenue, compared to 2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, and 2.4 million in the third quarter of


2004. As we stated in our earnings release, our Q4 service revenue results were disappointing not


having shown any upward movements for three quarters, despite adding sales capacity. A Q1,


2005 focus is to strengthen sales management and execution in this area, which Brian will speak to


you later. We expect service revenue to pick up in Q1 based on current activity levels. For the full


year 2004 service revenue was 10.6 million, compared to 9.4 million in 2003. The year-over-year


increase stand from several large Smartphone projects and a larger number of projects in general.


Now I'll turn to a discussion of gross profit margins.


For the last four quarters, overall gross margin has been hovering between 22% to 25%, which is a


vast improvement over 2003, wherein our margin was as low as 10%, and ended 2003 at 17% for


the full year. The year-over-year improvement, stand almost entirely from improvements in our


services area. The key focus of the company is the gross margin line given the variability in the


topline, which can stand from fairly significant swings in the sale of low margin third party software


products.


Third party software margins generally run in the mid-teens. In fact, margin contribution from sales


of high margin BSQUARE software and higher margin engineering services contributed


approximately 1.5 million more in gross margin during 2004, than third party software, despite


representing only 34% of total revenue. Software gross margin was 24% for the quarter, compared


to 20% and 21% for the fourth quarter of 2003, and the third quarter of 2004, respectively. The


increase in software margin in the fourth quarter was driven by a high margin BSQUARE software


products comprising a larger percentage of software revenue. For the full year 2004, software


margin was 23%, compared to 24% in the prior year.


Service gross margin was 22% in the fourth quarter, compared to a negative 16% in the fourth


quarter of 2003, and a positive 24% in the third quarter of 2004. In absolute dollars, fourth quarter


service gross margin was down a negligible 46,000 from the third quarter of ’04. For the full year


2004, service gross margin was 25%, compared to a negative 4% in the prior year. The year-over-


year increase reflects improvements in the areas of contract management, pricing and resource


utilization. It is unlikely, we will see a percentage margin improvement in third party software during


2005, as margins on sales of Microsoft embedded operating systems are increasingly competitive.


With regard to services we are focusing on increasing our margin, both in absolute dollars and as a


percentage, through topline growth and increased operational efficiencies. Specifically, for the last


several quarters, our service capacity has been under-utilized due to lower than expected sales


volumes. As billable hours and revenue increase there should be a little corresponding increase in


service cost, due to this capacity availability. As we do increase personnel through intimidated [ph]


increased activity, we plan to do so largely through our lower cost Taiwan operation.
