MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the CTG Fourth


Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an


opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And


as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.


I’ll now turn the conference over to Debbie Pawlowski, IR for CTG. Please go ahead.


Deborah K. Pawlowski, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your


interest in CTG. On the call today, we have CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt, and Brendan


Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Brendan are going to review


the results for the fourth quarter of 2009 and update you on the company’s strategy and outlook.


We’ll follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing our financial


results, you can access it at the company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected. Additional information concerning factors that could cause


actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings


release, as well as in the company’s SEC filings. You can find these at our website or the SEC’s


website at www.sec.gov. So, please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with


these precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Debbie, and good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us


this morning for our fourth quarter earnings conference call.


As you saw in our earnings release, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we were close to the midpoint of


our guidance for revenue and we’re at the midpoint of our guidance for earnings per share. For the


second consecutive quarter, we added 100 staff to our total head count and the strong demand that


we experienced in the second half of 2009 has continued into the first quarter of 2010. Most of that


increase in demand is coming from electronic medical record projects and our U.S. staffing


business. All indications are that CTG is going to have a good year in 2010.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the first quarter and the year, but first


I’m going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice


President


Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2009, CTG’s revenue was 67.7


million, a decrease of 15.7 million, or 19%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, compared


with the trailing third quarter of 2009, revenue increased 1.3% and was 4.6% higher on a per billing


day basis. Fourth quarter operating income was 2.6 million, a decrease of 0.7 million, or 21% year-

over-year. Operating margin decreased to 3.8% of revenue, only a 10 basis point decline from last


year’s 3.9% despite the decline in revenue from last year.


Our operating margin benefited from an increase in the profitability of solutions projects and


disciplined cost control, compared with the trailing third quarter of 2009, fourth quarter operating


income increased 82,000 or 3.3%. Net income was 1.6 million in the quarter, a decline of 29% from


2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and was unchanged from the third quarter 2009 net income.


On a per diluted share basis, net income was $0.10 for the quarter, the same as the 2009 third


quarter and a 33% decrease over the 2008 fourth quarter.


The fourth quarter 2008 results included a $0.03 per share benefit from the currency exchange


effect on intercompany borrowings. Excluding this effect, 2009 fourth quarter net income per share


was 17% lower than the 2008 fourth quarter.


Solutions revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 22.5 million, a 20% decline from last year’s


fourth quarter. Solutions represented 33% of total revenue in the quarter, a decrease from 34% a


year ago. Staffing revenue was down 18% to 45.2 million in total revenue.


Fourth quarter revenue from IBM, our largest customer, was 17.8 million, compared with 23 million


in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a percent of total revenue, IBM was down to 26% in the 2009


fourth quarter, compared with 28% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was 15.2 million, a 20% decrease from the 19.1 million


recorded in last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuation, European revenue in


the quarter would have decreased by 28% from last year. The effect of the fluctuations in the U.S.


dollar during the fourth quarter of 2009 increased our revenue by approximately 1.5 million, as


compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.


We continue to manage costs very carefully as reflected in the 19% decrease in operating


expenses from last year’s fourth quarter. SG&A expenses, as a percent of revenue, decreased to


18.4% from 18.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and from 19% in the trailing third quarter of 2009.


Direct costs, as a percentage of revenue, were 77.8% in the fourth quarter, compared with 77.6% in


the fourth quarter of 2008 and 77.2% in the trailing third quarter of 2009.


The 2009 fourth quarter’s results include equity compensation expense of approximately $0.02 per


diluted share net of tax. The 2008 fourth quarter results included $0.01 per diluted share net of tax


for equity compensation expense. The tax rate for the 2009 fourth quarter was 36.5%, compared


with 37.2% in the 2008 fourth quarter.


The full-year tax rate was approximately 39% and was favorably impacted by certain federal and


state tax credits realized during 2009. We expect the tax rate for the full year of 2010 to be between


40 and 42%.


As Jim noted, our head count has been increasing. We had approximately 2,900 employees at the


end of 2009, of which 88% were billable resources. On the balance sheet, our days sales


outstanding was 60 days at the end of 2009, consistent with the 60 days at the end of third quarter


of 2009 and slightly above the 57 days at the end of 2008. The year-over-year increase was


primarily a result of a change in the revenue mix.


Our cash provided from operations in the fourth quarter was approximately 0.3 million, as


compared with cash provided from operations of 4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The


decrease in the comparative quarters is primarily attributed to the reduction in the accounts


receivables that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, and alternatively, an increase in accounts


receivable during the fourth quarter of 2009 due to the revenue growth in the quarter, compared


with the trailing third quarter.
