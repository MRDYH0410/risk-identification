Now, I turn the call over to Navios Holdings' Chairman and CEO, Angeliki Frangou. Angeliki?

Thank you, Laura, and good morning to all of you joining us on today's call. I am pleased with the results for the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter, we reported revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $116.8 million and $28 million, respectively. We are beginning to see the effect of a healthier charter market on our business result. Rates for dry bulk vessels improved materially, with the time charter equivalent rate for the Q1 of 2018 about 40% higher than Q1 of 2017. In fact, adjusted EBITDA from core shipping operation increased over 10 times in Q1 2018, compared to Q1 2017.

Slide 3 provides our company highlights. Navios Holdings directly controlled 72 modern dry bulk vessels and manages 208 vessels, roughly with an average age of 7.7 years, a 16% younger than the industry average age. Our scale and the benefit through managing a large fleet allows to maintain industry leading operating costs, estimated to be 42% below than average of our listed peers. In an improving market, we created market exposure for 63.5% of available days.

Slide 4 and 5 illustrate a universe of diverse companies. Navios is a global brand with significant scale, management talent and industry relationships. Navios Holdings value derives from the dry bulk fleet it holds directly and the equity interest in its subsidiaries owning tankers, dry bulk vessels, containerships and ports.

Slide 6 outlines a tested operating platform, which is a favorable position to gain the benefits of recovering charter market. We believe, we have a premier operator in the dry bulk sector. Our scale of 200-plus vessels [ph] and a (00:03:41) significant operating leverage enable us to achieve substantial cost savings. We quantify the competitive advantage for 2017 at $38 million in terms of an estimated operating cost savings and discount for the year compared to our peers. We also decreased our G&A by 40% over the last three years.

Slide 7 provides some further insight into that $38 million of estimated operated cost savings. To adjust our efficiencies, we compare our operating cost to the published results of our peers. We've computed our peers' operating cost by reviewing their 20-Fs and related disclosures. As you can see from the slide, our analysis reveal that NM's operating costs were estimated at approximately 42% lower than the average of our listed peers. We believe that the savings demonstrate the substantial competitive benefit we can generate and the value [ph] delivered (00:04:45) to all our stakeholders. And we believe that computing our benefits based on actual operating result has been most persuasive way to demonstrate actual savings.

Slide 8, which provides an overview to our fleet renewal program. We have expanded our charter-in fleet at an attractive time. We acquired 10 and sold 3 vessels, thereby adding a net of 7 vessels to our fleet. In particular, we acquired a Capesize vessel [ph] built 2000 (00:05:18) for $10 million. The vessel includes the collateral value of our secured bonds by $4.25 million. With bareboat charter and charter-in, 9 Kamsarmaxes, some of them with purchase options.

We also sold three Supramax vessels for $19.5 million, which had an average age of about 17 years. This purchase options provide real value. We have no significant capital requirements, which allow for capital flexibility and expansion capabilities at an opportune time. As a result of this fleet renewal and expansion activities, we improved the average age of our fleet by 13% and increased our fleet size by 11%. Also, our charter-in fleet days have increased [indiscernible] (00:06:10) for additional revenue generation. Finally, 70% of our charter-in fleet has purchase options.

Slide 9 shows the cash flow potential of our fleet in a market recovery. Our time charter rate for Q1 of 2018 was $10,983 per day. For the remaining nine months of 2018, our fleet has 17,113 available days, of which 10,870 days have market exposure.

At current rate of $15,162 per day, our fleet will generate $43.6 million of free cash flow. If rates were to increase to a 20-year average, we will have about $115.5 million of free cash flow. In fact, our fleet can generate an additional $11 million of free cash flow for every $1,000 increase in charter rate.

Slide 10 sets forth Navios cost structure. Our expected daily revenue for the remaining nine months of 2018 is $14,368 per day. We fixed 36.5% of our available days at an average daily rate of $11,953 per day. Daily revenue may increase by $2,038 per day based on an expected impact on current market rates on open and index days and an additional $377 based on the current NNA and NMM dividend.

Our breakeven cost for 2018 is expected to be $11,819 per day, our cost include all operating expenses, scheduled dry dock expenses, charter-in expenses for our charter-in fleet, G&A cash expenses as well as interest expense in capital repayments.

Slide 11 highlights our strong liquidity position, net debt [ph] to book (00:08:30) capitalization was 72.1% and we had cash of $121.9 million as of March 31, 2018. We have no significant committed shipping growth CapEx or any material debt maturity until 2022.

I would like now to turn the call over to Tom Beney, Navios Holdings' Senior Vice President of Commercial Affairs.

Thank you, Angeliki. Slide 12 presents our diversified dry bulk fleet consisting of 72 dry bulk vessels, totaling 7.3 million deadweight, split between Capesize, Panamax and [ph] Supramax Handy (00:09:08). We continue to be one of the largest U.S. listed dry bulk operators in the world.

Established over 60 years ago, we have 65 vessels on the water. The average age of the fleet is 7.7 years, 16% younger than the industry average. Navios Group's total fleet of 208 vessels includes 54 tankers, 42 container vessels and 112 dry bulkers and is a highly diversified public shipping group.

Please turn to slide 14. The IMF forecasts world GDP growth at 3.9% for 2018 and 2019. Emerging markets are expected to grow at a healthy 4.9%. On the back of synchronized global economic growth, dry bulk trade grew by 4% in 2017, and is forecasted to rise by 2.6% in 2018, above the expected 2.1% net fleet growth.

Moving to slide 15, data from the IMF shows further evidence of the global economic expansion as all major economies are growing simultaneously. This was last experienced during the period of 2004 to 2007 and previous to that in the late 1980s.

Important for seaborne in trade, the percentage of countries showing export growth has risen to 85%, which is the highest on record. I would like to point out that the dry bulk market still have substantial upside as it remains above 40% below the 20-year average.

Turning to slide 16, worldwide steel production experienced a 5% increase in 2017 on the back of firming steel prices and Chinese steel production rose by 6%. Up to end of March 2018, Chinese steel production is up a further 5%. Chinese steel exports reduced to cater for the increased domestic demand, which has been stimulated by large infrastructure projects and recovery in the housing market. The One Belt, One Road project is a cornerstone of the Chinese economic plans for the next five years, and supports steel and power demand inside and outside China.

Chinese domestic production of iron ore in 2018 is down 36% year-on-year in Q1. Substitution of Chinese expensive low quality iron ore with higher quality and lower priced imports continues. Iron ore imports into China for 2017 rose 5% or 50 million tons and is forecast to rise further in 2018. While I recently reiterated that they expect to meet their 2018 production target of about 390 million tons, which will result in increased export volume for the balance of the year since Q1 was negatively affected due to seasonal weather issues. This should support Cape rates as 1 ton of Brazilian ore equates to almost 3 tons of Australian ore in ton miles.

Please turn to slide 17. The Chinese government continues to rationalize domestic coal production closing down small, inefficient mines and encouraging consolidation of large mining groups. It is expected that the restructuring of the Chinese coal industry will continue to encourage imports as inefficient polluting mines are closed.

During the peak winter season, stocks of thermal coal of power plants in both, China and India have reached uncomfortably low levels, prompting both governments to allow additional coal imports to maintain power supply. In 2017, Chinese seaborne coal imports were up by about 10%. And through March of this year, they were up by 28% today.

Turning to slide 18, agricultural production worldwide continues to increase, after a strong 7.1% growth in 2017 forecast to 2018 after a further increase. Worldwide grain trade has grown by 5.5% CAGR since 2008, mainly driven by Asian demand.

Demand increases are focused on Asian economies and especially China, where incomes are rising and diets are changing. Chinese imports of soybeans in 2017 were up 15%. Most of the increases in grain production are based in the Americas or European regions, increasing ton miles for longer trips to Asia.

Moving to slide 19. In 2017, 34% of total expected newbuildings never delivered. In spite of a significantly better market this year, the non-delivery rate increased to 41% year-to-date. Forecast offer 2.1% net fleet growth in 2018, the lowest since 2000.

Based on the current order book and shipyard availability, low net fleet growth is expected to continue over the next few years. In addition, as a result of incoming changes in IMO regulations, scrapping of older vessels is expected to continue.

Turning to slide 20, 2017 ended with another low net fleet growth of 3%, about half of the [ph] Long Run (00:14:17) average fleet growth of 5.8%, and below the dry bulk trade growth of 4%. Total scrapping in 2017 was 15 million tons.

The current dry bulk order book before non-deliveries is about 10% of the total fleet. And we note that vessels over 20 years of age, equal about 7.5%. Given forecasted trade growth, there is balance between new expected deliveries and potential scrap candidates.

The fundamentals for 2018 and beyond remain positive. In fact, forecast for 2018 show that demand growth of 2.6% will be more than the level supply growth of 2.1%. With demand above supply, the market should continue to recover and support increased charter rates going forward.

I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Achniotis for the Q1 financial results.

Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Please turn to slide 21 for the review of the financial highlights of the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by 60% to $28.1 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $17.5 million in Q1 of 2017.

EBITDA net income for Q1 in both, 2017 and 2018, were adjusted to exclude book losses relating to the sale of two vessels. In Q1 of 2018, we reported a $6.7 million book loss relating to the sale of the Navios Herakles, a 2001-built Panamax vessel. The vessel was sold for $7.7 million net.

In Q1 of 2017, we recorded a book loss of $9.1 million, relating to the sale of the Navios Ionian, a 2000-built Handymax vessel that was sold for $5.3 million net. The increase in EBITDA is mainly due to an over 13 times increase in the EBITDA contribution of the dry bulk fleet, due to a 40% increase in the TCE rate achieved in Q1 of 2018, compared to Q1 of 2017, which is a reflection of the improvement in the dry bulk market.

The increase is also attributable to a 54% increase in the EBITDA contribution of Navios South American Logistics, due to the commencement of the [ph] Vale (00:16:29) contract at the [ph] iron port (00:16:31) in Uruguay.

The increase was mitigated by a reduction equity pick-up from affiliated companies, specifically Navios Acquisition as the tanker sector is at a different point [ph] in its (00:16:43) cycle. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $34.1 million, compared to a loss of $39.6 million in 2017.

Please turn now to slide 22, where the balance sheet highlights are presented. We continue to maintain a healthy cash balance as of March 31, 2018, the cash balance was about $122 million, compared to $134 million at the end of December 2017. Deposits for asset acquisitions reduced to $7.5 million, compared to $36.8 million at December 31, 2017, as Navios South American Logistics took delivery of three new push boats during the quarter. I would like to point out that we have no significant maturities until 2022.

Over the next few slides, we will briefly review our affiliates. Please turn to slide 23. Navios Holding's owns about 20% of Navios Partners, including a 2% GP interest. Navios Partners owns a fleet of 38 vessels, 33 dry bulk and 5 containers.

NMM also owns about 36% of Navios containers, a growth vehicle dedicated to [ph] Containers (00:17:57). NMM is a unique platform generating significant cash flow with no significant near-term maturities. The company is currently in the process of renewing its dry bulk fleet with younger and larger vessels.

In 2017 and year-to-date 2018, NMM has added 11 vessels and have sold [ph] to (00:18:18) with an average age of 20 years, reducing the average of its dry bulk fleet by 12%. We expect to receive about $3 million in dividends from NMM in 2018. And since 2008, we received about $195 million in dividends.

Turning to slide 24. Navios Holdings owns about 48% of Navios Acquisition. NNA has a fleet of 35 modern high quality tankers with an average age of 7.3 years, diversified between [ph] crude (00:18:49) product and chemical tankers.

NNA also owns about 59% of Navios Midstream Partners, including a 2% GP interest. NAP is an MLP with 6 VLCCs and is expected to provide NNA with about $10 million in distributions in 2018. We expect to receive about $6 million dividends from Navios Acquisition during 2018. And since 2011, we received about $84 million in dividends.

Moving to slide 25, Navios Holdings owns about 3% of Navios Containers. Navios Containers is a company that was setup in June 2017 with the intention of taking advantage of opportunities in the container sector. Since its inception, the company raised $180 million at the Oslo OTC market and acquired 25 vessels, mostly through distressed transactions.

This concludes my presentation. At this point, I will turn the call over to Ioannis Karyotis, for his review of the Navios South American Logistics' results.

Thank you, George. Slide 26 provides an overview of the Navios Logistics business. Navios Logistics operates three port terminals. Navios Logistics complements its port business with its barge fleet for river transportation and product tanker fleet for coastal cabotage trade.

Please turn to page 27. For the overall results of the first quarter of 2018, revenue increased 19% year-on-year to $52.3 million, and EBITDA increased 67% year-on-year to $16.8 million. Q1 2018 Port segment revenue increased 59%, compared to the same period last year and EBITDA increased 178% to $12.1 million. The increase is mainly attributable to the operation of the new iron ore terminal.

In Q1 2018, the iron ore terminal generated approximately $10.2 million EBITDA. For 2018, we are estimating about $40 million EBITDA from the Vale contract based on the annual minimum guaranteed quantity.

The grain terminal had a weaker performance compared to Q1 2017, as grain export and transshipment volumes were impacted by the drought in Uruguay and Argentina. The liquid terminal had an improved performance compared to Q1 2017, mainly due to higher storage revenue.

In the Barge segment, EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 was positively affected by two extraordinary events. $1 million gain from the sale of two self-propelled barges and $1.1 million other income from an arbitration of ore. Excluding these two events for comparison purposes, Q1 revenue decreased 10% and EBITDA decreased from $3.5 million to $1.6 million. The decrease compared to the same period last year is mainly attributable to lower liquid cargo transportation.

Q1 is a seasonally low quarter for grain transportation. Cabotage business Q1 EBITDA increased to $3.1 million compared to $0.2 million in the same period last year. The increase is attributable to higher number of operating days, due to less scheduled dry dock and off-hire days compared to Q1 2017.

Net loss in Q1 2018, reduced 65% to $1 million from $3 million in the same period last year. The improvement is attributable to the increase in EBITDA that was partially mitigated by higher depreciation expenses related to the iron ore terminal and higher interest expenses. The increase in interest expenses was due to the new Term Loan B issued in Q4 2017, and reduced capitalized interest following the completion of the construction of the iron ore terminal.

Please turn to slide 28. Navios Logistics had a strong balance sheet. Cash at the end of Q1 2018 was $82.1 million, compared to $79.9 million at the end of the 2017. Net debt to book capitalization was 55%, compared to 56% at the year-end 2017.

Now, I would like to turn the call back to Angeliki.

Questions. [Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from the line of Justine Fisher of Goldman Sachs.

Good morning. How are you?

Good morning.

Can I ask a broader question about the time charter versus the acquisition of ships and you guys are chartering in ships to grow the fleet. And I'm assuming that the rates that you're making money chartering them in at lower rates and then able to take advantage of the improving market to charter them out at higher rates. Will Navios start to buy some more ships at some point? I mean, when do you start to make that decision to buy more vessels as opposed to charter them in?

In essence, we value those vessels – almost our Core Fleet that we will exercise the options. Just to give you an idea, if you see on the – we have, first of all we have 70% of our charter-in vessels have purchase option. On the new level charter-in vessels, overall cost is including the OpEx and everything is below $9,000 – is about $8,000. And you have purchase options from here for every year at the declining of $1.2 million per year.

So, you actually are able to – we are seeing as these vessels as part of our Core Fleet, which we will also exercise the option, when we find that it's more attractive than the financing, [ph] is in essence a (00:25:03) financing almost way. That gives you the purchase option and it brings you at a very convenient, it's leveraging at very low cost, taking advantage of the Japanese interest rate environment to be honest.

Okay. Thanks. And then another question on the duration of the time charter, so I'm looking at some of the ones you guys have signed for some Capesizes, and they are all reflecting the stronger market. You've got some charters in the mid-teens and it look like they're about one year duration. I'm just looking a lot of them end in March of 2019. And so, is that kind of sweet spot of the charter market now, where your clients are saying, okay, we know rates are rising, we're willing to do it for one year, but you can't really lock-in kind of a two- or three-year charter at that rate, yet that the market's just not that strong. So it's kind of the one year where there's the most activity [ph] in house – and how (00:25:55) deep is that market for kind of mid-teens to $20,000 time charters now for a year, let's say.

I will say that [ph] on (00:26:05) the last three, four [ph] ways, (00:26:08) we had in our headquarters almost every major commodity [ph] house (00:26:16) coming and asking for [ph] a deal (00:26:19). What you see that the one-year rate is well established at – even when the rates will drop to about $8,000 to $9,000 on the spot market, on the Capsizes, you are doing [ph] deals or one at close $19,000, $20,000 (00:26:34).

So the $20,000 and low-20s is a well-established level for the one-year rate. And to be honest, is a good charter rate. I'm not saying we are very bullish on the market, but we see that there is a good level, where you can fix [indiscernible] (00:26:55) the one-year rate.

We have now started seeing also some two years rate, three-year rates on the [indiscernible] (00:27:07) at around high [ph] 13s (00:27:09), so this has started developing. The strategy of Navios is as we have about two-thirds of our available days exposed to the market. But, selectively, we will start facing at nice margins that we're seeing developing at around 20% and trying to create different maturities, meaning creating a two-year, three-year and creating some cash flows and visibility.

Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, I have one more question for George, if I may. You said that you acquired a Capesize for $10 million, but it added $4.25 million to the bond collateral pool. Why was there a difference in how much collateral was added to the pool versus what you paid for the ship?

We took a vessel out, which we sold and we added a vessel with a higher value. I think you will see more transactions like that exercising – we will be exercising options that we have in our books for younger vessels 2007, 2008 and substituting with all the vessels that we're taking out.

Okay. So, that was a net addition to the collateral pool over and above what the previous vessel was. Okay. I see. Thank you very much for the time.

Thank you.

And now I would like to turn the floor back over to Angeliki Frangou for any additional or closing remarks.

Thank you. This completes our Q1 result.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.
