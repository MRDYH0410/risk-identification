MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the PGT, Incorporated Fourth Quarter


2010 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will


conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator


Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.


I would like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Brad West. Sir, please go ahead.


Brad West, Corporate Controller


Good morning, and thank you for joining us for PGT’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010


conference call. I’m Brad West, Corporate Controller, and I am joined by Rod Hershberger,


President and CEO; and Jeff Jackson, Executive Vice President and CFO. And Rod and Jeff will


represent PTG on this morning’s call.


Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s conference call may contain statements


concerning the company’s future prospects, business strategies, and industry trends. Such


statements are considered to be forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation


Reform Act of 1995.


These statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty.


Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please


refer to the February 24th press release and our most recent Form 8-K and other documents filed


with the SEC. We undertake no obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking


statements.


A copy of our press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at


www.pgtinc.com. Included in the press release are, the unaudited consolidated balance sheets and


statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP and adjusted information, which was


quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. Our company uses non-GAAP measurements as key metrics for


evaluating performance internally.


A detailed explanation of these non-GAAP measurements can be found in our Form 8-K filed


February 24th with the SEC. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the


presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we believe these non-GAAP


measurements provide additional information for investors to facilitate the comparison of past and


present performance.


For today’s call, Rod will provide an overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full


year. Then, Jeff will discuss our results in more detail. After their prepared remarks, they will take


your questions.


With that, let me turn the call over to Rod Hershberger. Rod?


Rodney Hershberger, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. I’m pleased to report that we closed out 2010 with a 5.9%


increase in sales, our first year-over-year sales increase since 2006. This includes an 8.4%


increase in our fourth quarter of 2010 sales, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our growth


was driven by our Florida market sales with an increase of $4 million, or 14.4%, compared to prior


year.

WinGuard sales increased by $1.7 million, or 8%, due to both the success of our new aluminum


door launched last fall and an increase in vinyl WinGuard sales, where many replacement


customers took advantage of tax credit offered. Vinyl WinGuard sales into Florida increased $1


million, including $542,000 in sales into the southern part of Florida. Our new PremierVue line of


high-end vinyl impact products contributed $300,000 in additional sales.


Finally, a version of our new vinyl non-impact products SpectraGuard designed for the Florida


market and launched last year contributed $1.1 million in additional sales. This growth was partially


offset by a decrease in international sales, down $400,000 for the quarter and a decrease in our


out-of-state sales of $600,000 or 9.4%, driven by curtain wall revenue, down $500,000.


Exclusive of curtain wall revenues, sales in the fourth quarter were up 10% led by increases into


both the R&R and new construction markets; both of which increased 10% over a year ago. As a


percentage of total sales for the fourth quarter of 2010, R&R sales accounted for 74% and new


construction sales accounted for 26% of sales.


Comparing our fourth quarter to the prior year fourth quarter, the gross margin contribution from our


fourth quarter sales increase was offset by a shift in mix between impact and non-impact and


product mix within impact sales. In 2010, we recorded consolidation charges of $885,000,


compared to restructuring charges of $1.1 million in 2009.


As a percentage of sales, adjusted gross margin was 25.8% in 2010 versus an adjusted gross


margin of 28.2% in 2009. SG&A costs adjusted for the 2010 consolidation charges and 2009


restructuring charges increased $2.1 million, due mainly to an increase of $1 million in bonuses;


$500,000 in increased salaries resulting from returning employees to their 2009 base; a $600,000


increase in non-cash stock compensation expense, and a $300,000 increase in healthcare costs.


Driven by our non-cash impairment charges of $5.6 million, and consolidation charges of $2.1


million, we recorded a net loss of $12.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. These charges are a


result of our decision to consolidate our operations into our Florida facility.


Adjusted EBITDA was $228,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is down from adjusted EBITDA


of $2.9 million from the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was driven mainly by a shift in


mix toward lower margin non-impact products, which offset contribution margin gained on additional


sales, as well as the SG&A increases just described.


We recorded an adjusted net loss of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared to an adjusted net


income of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Within our core market, total housing starts


were down 2.2%, multi-family starts were up 6.6%, the single-family starts decreased 3.7%,


compared to a year ago. Market conditions remain difficult, but overall housing starts and permits


appear to have reached the bottom and are starting to show signs of life.


During the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced the decision to consolidate our North Carolina


operations into our Florida facility. We expect that consolidation will enhance long-term


competitiveness and improve efficiencies. Annualized savings will be $7 million with about half of


that realized in 2011. Approximately 300 new positions are being created in Venice in support of a


transition, scheduled to be complete by the end of our second quarter.


We received tremendous support from the local economic development corporation in Sarasota


County, which proved critical to our decision-making process. We believe transitioning to a


centralized location will optimize our manufacturing capacity and logistics, positioning PGT to be a


stronger company with focus on growing our share within our core wind-borne debris market areas.
