Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about Navios. Forward-looking statements are statements that are

remarks; next Mr. Petrone will provide an operational update and an overview of the market


fundamentals. Following Mr. Petrone’s remarks, Mr. Achniotis will review Navios’ financial results

concluding remarks. At the conclusion of remarks, the Company will open the call to take your


questions.


At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Ms. Angeliki Frangou, Chairman and CEO of Navios.


Angeliki?


Angeliki Frangou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Lora and good morning. During the third quarter we continued to benefit from our


strategy of increasing our fleet on long term periods with high-quality counterparties. Our financial


performance reflects the high-low throughout the past 12 months. During this time we have worked


hard to reposition Navios in the current market.


For the third quarter of 2009 we earned approximately 56 million of EBITDA, representing an


increase of 74% over the adjusted EBITDA of 32 million in the third quarter of 2008. For the nine


month period, we earned approximately 142.4 million, representing an increase of about 25% over


the adjusted EBITDA of 113.4 million in the same period of 2008.


We are also pleased to announce a dividend in respect to the third quarter of 2009 of $0.06 per


share, payable on January 7, 2010, to shareholders of record on December 18, 2009. Navios


remains one of the few [inaudible] companies, but maintains a dividend policy.


As you can see on slide five, our hard work was favorably recognized by the capital market. We


recently successfully accessed the high yield market and closed a 400 million note offering with a


coupon of 8 7/ 8%. The notes are secured by first by mortgages on 15 vessels and have a maturity


of eight years.


Of the offering proceeds, 105 million will serve to partially finance the purchase of Navios Lumen


and Navios Phoenix, both of which we expect to be delivered in December of 2009. The high yield


also is a strategic addition to our liquidity as we have used most of the net proceeds to repay


amortizing debt facilities.

As a result, we will have additional cash flow which we can put to a creative use. The secured


notes also play an important role in the capital structure. Since we closed the unsecured notes


offering in 2006, we have increased our assets and debt structure by approximately more than


100%, thus increasing the portion of our debt structure, that does not amortize is appropriate.


Please turn to slide seven. The high yield offering reaffirms Navios’ more than strong liquidity


position. Our net debt to total capitalization is approximately 51%, and we maintain significant cash


balance of about 257 million, with overall liquidity of approximately 452 million. Navios Holdings


continues to have a low operating breakeven and a substantial cash flow.


Slide eight illustrates Navios substantial revenue and low operating costs. As you can see, almost


100% of our revenue is fixed for 2009 at $24,931 per day, and approximately 85% is fixed for 2010


at $30,243 per day. We have a low operating breakeven of $16,831 per day. The net result of this


is that we are enjoying a substantial cash flow during 2010. Please note that the operating


breakeven number includes operating expenses, dry-docking, charter-in expenses. It also includes


general and administrative expenses including [inaudible], interest expense and capital


repayments.


I would also like now to discuss briefly recent developments on slide 10. As you can see, we sold


Navios Apollon to Navios Partners for 32 million in an all-cash transaction. The Apollon is an Ultra-


Handymax built in 2000 with a deadweight tons of 52,000. The Navios Apollon will serve as a three


year time charter. We also upgraded our fleet by purchasing the Navios Celestial for an effective


purchase price of approximately 34 million. The Navios Celestial is currently waiting in port.


We also agreed to provide visibility to the investors of Navios Partners by increasing our


management fee for an additional three years. As you may recall, the original management


agreement provides for a fixed fee for two years of 4,000 per Panamax vessel per day, and 5,000


per Capesize vessel per day.


We have fixed the fee for an additional period ending in November 16, 2011 of 4,500 per Ultra-


Handymax vessel per day, which is a newly established rate, and 4,400 per Panamax vessel per


day, and $5,500 per day per Capesize vessel. This is a 10% increase from the previous period.


With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ted Petrone, Navios’ President, who will take you


through the Navios operation in the industry. Ted?


Ted C. Petrone, President – Navios Corporation


Thank you, Angeliki and good morning all. Please turn to slide 12. Navios Maritime Holdings


currently consists of 59 vessels, equal to 6.3 million deadweight. Navios has 38 vessels in the


water with an average age of 4.7 years. Our fleet is considerably younger than the industry average


age of about 16 years. The fleet is comprised of 23 Capes, 15 Panamaxes, 18 Ultra-Handymaxes


and three Handys. Of the 27 long term charter-in vessels, Navios holds purchase options on 11 of


these vessels.


Please turn to slide 13. In the third quarter, Navios continued its policy of locking in secured long


term cash flow by chartering out two Panamax vessels; Navios Star and the Navios Altair, on one


year charters to first class counterparties. Navios average charter-out rate for the core fleet is


$24,931 for 2009. This rate increases in each year up to 2012, to 30,243 in 2010; 35,080 for 2011;


and $36,098 for 2012.


Our long term bias is evident from the percentage of revenue days that our core fleet was fixed;


99.5% in 2009, 83.3% in 2010, 63.4% for 2011, and 56.6% for 2012. From this we will enjoy
