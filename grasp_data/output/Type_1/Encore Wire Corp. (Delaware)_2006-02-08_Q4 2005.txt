MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining the Encore Wire's Fourth Quarter Earnings


Conference Call. As a reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode, and we will conduct a Q&A


session at the end of the call. At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce Daniel Jones, President of


Encore Wire.


Daniel L. Jones, President, Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer


Thank you Edmond. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation fourth quarter conference call. I am Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Operating


Officer of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer.


Encore Wire has just posted record sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of '05.


Fueled by rising raw material cost, we were able to raise the price of our wire and increase


margins, while achieving record company sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and year. Our


fourth quarter earnings of $1.50 per share is the best quarterly earnings in the history of the


company, improving strongly over the third quarter earnings of $0.48 per share.


Margin started improving late in the second quarter, gained momentum through the third and fourth


quarters. Tight supplies of raw materials, such as copper rod, PVC resin and natural gas, helped


keep margin strong during the fourth quarter. Our plants ran very efficiently during the quarter


enabling us to maintain low production cost. We are utilizing our manufacturing flexibility to produce


efficiently and allows us to maintain seasonally low or seasonally lean inventory levels.


Our general and administrative costs remain extremely cost. We continue to focus on tight cost


controls throughout our operation. We are pleased to report that the construction of our new


armored cable plant is on schedule. This natural extension of our product line has significant long


term potential to grow the sales and earnings of Encore Wire. We continue to strive to improve


margins, while resisting the urge to gain volume by cutting prices, by focusing our customer


retention on our innovative products and superior order fill rates.


We believe there is room for significant growth of Encore Wire sales and earnings in the future. We


are very proud of Encore's achievements and the hard work our employees and associates put


forth to make it happen.


Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer, will now discuss our financial results. Frank.


Frank J. Bilban, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute I will review Encore's financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a copy


of Encore's press release covering Encore's financial results. This release is available on the


Internet, or you can call Doris Eaterlin [ph] or me at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we begin, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question-and-answer period


that follows, we may make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking. In


order to comply with securities legislation and instead of attempting to identify each particular


statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements involve certain risks and


uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. I refer

each of you to the company's SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed discussion of


these risks and uncertainties. Now the financial results.


Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 65.5% to $244.2 million versus $147.5 million in


the fourth quarter of 2004. The $244.2 million in sales represents a new quarterly company record.


Sales dollars increased primarily due to price increases for wire sold in 2005. Net income in the


fourth quarter of 2005 was $35.4 million compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.


Fully diluted income per share was $1.50 in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $0.27 in the


same period of 2004. The $35.4 million in net income and the $1.50 earnings per share also set


new company records.


On a sequential quarter comparison, sales for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 17.7% to $244.2


million, compared to $207.5 million during the third quarter of 2005. Net income for the fourth


quarter of '05 increased to $35.4 million versus $11.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. Fully


diluted net income per common share was $1.50 in the fourth quarter of 2005 versus $0.48 in the


third quarter of 2005.


Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased 25.7% to a record $758.1 million


compared to the previous record high of $603.2 million set during 2004. Net income for 2005 was a


record $60.1 million, eclipsing the previous high of $33.4 million in 2004. Fully diluted net income


per share was $2.13 in the full year of 2005, versus $1.42 in 2004.


Our strong cash flow enabled us to pay down our debt by $13.1 million in the quarter despite a


working capital increase of 19.1 million and capital expenditures of 7.1 million in the quarter. Our


debt balance remains conservative with most of our revolver availability untapped and our interest


cost is low.


We also want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the


conclusion of this session. You should call 866-206-0173 and enter the conference ID 165759#.


I will now turn the floor over to Daniel Jones, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Daniel.


Daniel L. Jones, President, Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer


Thank you. As Frank highlighted, Encore posted record profits during the quarter and the year. I


believe we are well positioned for future growth. Edmond, we are ready to take the question and


answers.
