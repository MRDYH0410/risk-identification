MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Petroleum Development


Corporation’s Fourth Quarter and Year-end Results Conference Call. At this time all parties are in


a listen-only mode, and a question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.


[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to


introduce your host, Mr. Steven Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer.


Steven R. Williams, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning for our 2004 earnings conference call.


With me today is Darwin Stump, Petroleum Development Corporation’s Chief Financial Officer and


we'll be running through both the financial results and some of the operating highlights for the


previous year. In the course of talking, we will always no doubt you have seen from other


companies, be making some forward-looking statements, talking a little bit about what we are


seeing coming in the year ahead. To the extent that we do, they obviously are based on what we


believe to be reasonable assumptions and estimates, but actual results could differ materially.


Take the time please to read the full forward-looking statements. It's available on your slide there.


With that, I would like to move forward and to the next slide and turn the presentation at this point in


time over to Darwin Stump, our Chief Financial Officer.


Darwin L. Stump, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer


Thank you Steve and thank all of you for joining us here this morning. We had a great year, as


everyone I believe knows. We've had record fourth quarter and full year gross revenue. We've had


a record fourth quarter and full year net income also. We were able to reduce long-term debt from


53 million at the end of 2003 down to 21 million at the end of 2004. We had oil gas capital


expenditures this year of $42.2 million.


One item that we think is very important in oil and gas companies is cash flow and we like to think


of it as an adjusted cash flow from operations. We had $62.5 million cash flow from operations.


Since it is a non-GAAP measure, we have to define that and we define adjusted cash flow as net


income plus non-cash charges of depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income


taxes.


Some of our uses this year, we spent $36.9 million for drilling and development; $4.6 million for


undeveloped properties, that's primarily oil and gas leases that we plan on drilling some of it last


year and in 2005; producing properties of $700,000; and a reduction of long-term debt of $32


million.


The fourth quarter, we had record revenue of $72.6 million; that compares to $59.5 million in 2003.


That is reflected by the higher oil and gas production that we had this year, also the higher oil and


natural gas prices that we have experienced all year. Actually, the fourth quarter was our highest


priced gas quarter, and also oil quarter in the year. I know the NYMEX price was well over $7 the


last couple of months of the year.


For the full year, we had revenues of $290 million. That compares with $203 million that we had in


2003.

Our net income this year was $34.1 million and that's up from $22.6 million in 2003.
 
Diluted


earnings per share increased from $1.39 in ‘03 to $2.05 in ‘05. In the fourth quarter, we had net


income of $8.3 million, that’s up from $8 million in 2003. The diluted earnings per share was the


same at $0.49 as it was in the fourth quarter last year.


A couple of items. In the fourth quarter, I guess, all of you know, with our compliance with


Sarbanes-Oxley this year, we had Sarbanes-Oxley costs in the fourth quarter of approximately $0.5


million and also our income tax rate for the year 2004 did increase this year and that hit us in the


fourth quarter of 2004. We could probably expect a higher income tax rate going forward in 2005 at


approximately a 38% rate, same, I believe, this year’s actual net tax – effective tax rate of the


current and deferred was about 37.62%.


For the full year, our adjusted cash flow was $62.5 million. That’s up from $45.6 million in 2003. In


the fourth quarter, we had adjusted cash flow of $14.6 million. Our capital expenditures in 2004,


while they were only approximately $42 million and we were able to pay down debt, we do have a


very, pretty aggressive capital budget for 2005. As we released in January, we have a capital


expenditure budget this year of $108 million. Some of that what we look at is we did – we expected


to have a higher capital – CapEx budget in 2004, and we will just kind of extend that over to 2005.


Steve, do you have some?


Steven R. Williams, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Okay, Darwin. Thank you very much. I might make one note on the $0.49 a share for the fourth


quarter, just the incremental SOX costs alone were – were enough – would have been the


difference between $0.49 and $0.52, which was our earnings for each of the previous three


quarters. And, had we not had the sort of the somewhat higher tax rate, and as a result we had


some catch-up to do with the previous quarters, that would have been another $0.03 to $0.05 on


top of that. So actually our fourth quarter was a little bit stronger other than sort of those two


unusual catch-up items that took it down to the $0.49. But nonetheless, for the year, from the $1.39


to $2.05 is a pretty significant increase, I think.


We go forward now to the operating highlights. We did have in 2004 a total production of 12.7 Bcf


equivalent, that’s a 21% increase from 2003, and a continuation of a trend of production growth that


we will see a little clearer on a graph and on one of the following slide. The Rocky Mountain region


continues to be the heart and soul of our growth efforts, as production in that region increased by


36.5% year-to-year over the 12-month period. Rocky Mountain production – our Rocky Mountain


region production now represents about 72% of our total production. So, it’s certainly becoming the


predominant factor in our company as you consider we first drilled our first well there in 1999, right


at the end of 1999. That’s a pretty substantial shift in the fortune of the country – the company from


two eastern regions to our western region.


We drilled 158 wells in 2004, up from 111 in 2003. A lot of those, a vast majority of them, in fact,


were drilled in conjunction with our company-sponsored partnerships. In fact, 137 of those wells


were. The other 21 wells were drilled in two areas, partly in our NECO properties, which stands for


the Northeast Colorado. And then, one exploratory well in the Northwest part of Colorado, that we


will talk about some more later in the presentation. Our Sand Wash Basin exploratory test, at this


point in time, of the 158 wells, essentially we have four dry holes in Wattenberg Field in conjunction


with the partnership wells. All of our NECO wells were successful and as were all of the wells in


the Piceance Basin. The exploratory well, as of the end of the year, we had just begun testing it


when we were forced to shutdown the testing due to some lease restrictions that center around


environmental protection on the federal acreage where the wells are located. And, we will – we


won’t be able to get back in to complete that testing until the second quarter. And in the course of


normal operations once the well is drilled, completed and in production, we would have the access
