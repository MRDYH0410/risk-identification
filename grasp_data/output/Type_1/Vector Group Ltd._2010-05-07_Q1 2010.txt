MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Welcome to Vector Group’s First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Before the call


begins, I would like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.


Now, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s first quarter 2010 earnings


conference call.


With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of Liggett Vector Brands and Liggett; and


Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call, I will provide an update on our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the first quarter of 2010. Ron will then discuss the performance of Liggett for the period and provide


his perspective on industry developments and the competitive environment. After that, we will take


your questions.


Let me begin by saying that I’m very pleased that the strong performance in volume growth trends


our company experienced in the second half of 2009 have continued in the first quarter of 2010.


Last year confronted with the challenges created by legislation enacted by Congress that increased


the federal excise tax on cigarettes by $6.17 per carton and granted the Food and Drug


Administration regulatory authority of tobacco products, we made the decision to strategically invest


in the growth of our tobacco business.


Sustainable volume growth is a priority for us and Ron will provide more detail on that in a moment.


But we are very encouraged with the early results and believe that our performance in 2009 and the


first quarter of 2010 validate the strategy that we put in place. With respect to real estate, we


continue to see positive signs in a challenging market environment and improvements in our


performance at New Valley and Douglas Elliman. We continue to believe that there are good


investment opportunities in this market and we plan to make appropriate investments when the


opportunities meet our criteria.


Before discussing the financial results, I’m also pleased to report that in April 2010, we enhanced


our strong financial position by completing a private placement of $75 million of our 11% senior


secured notes due 2015. Our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of


approximately 203 million as of March 31, 2010 or 276 million after adjusting for the notes offering.


Additionally, as of March 31, 2010, we held investment securities and partnership interests with a


fair market value of approximately $132.6 million.


Now let’s turn to the key financials for the three months ended March 31, 2010 for Vector Group.


For the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, Vector Group revenues were 222.1 million compared to


121.2 million in the 2009 first quarter. The increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily due to higher


prices related to the increase in federal excise taxes, which became effective on April 1, 2009.


The company recorded operating income of $31 million in the 2010 first quarter compared to the


operating income of 31.2 million in the 2009 first quarter. First quarter 2010 net income was 11.9

million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to 3.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the 2009


period.


Our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2009, include a pre-tax gain of $5


million related to the 1999 trademark transaction with Philip Morris, pre-tax impairment charges of


8.5 million on real estate and pre-tax restructuring charges of 1 million. Adjusting for these items,


our net income for 2009 would have been 5.7 million or $0.08 per diluted common share.


Now I will return the call over to Ron Bernstein for a review of our tobacco subsidiaries. Ron.


Ronald J. Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer, Liggett Group LLC and Liggett


Vector Brands Inc.


Thank you, Howard, and good morning to everybody. As Howard mentioned and as we’ve


discussed in previous calls, prior to the implementation of the 2009 federal excise tax increase, we


believe that the largest fee or tax increase in tobacco product history would create both new


challenges and opportunities in the marketplace. To take advantage of those opportunities, we


implemented a business strategy to aggressively, but prudently invest in the evolving market and


position Liggett to achieve meaningful long-term volume growth.


Through the first quarter of 2010, we feel very good about the results of our strategy and continue


to see positive trends for Liggett going forward. On the year-end conference call, I mentioned that


our company had surpassed 3% share of the cigarette market for the first time since 1992. I’m


pleased to report that Liggett has continued to grow its market share through the first quarter of


2010. I will elaborate more on our performance in a moment, but first let me turn to the financials.


In 2009, as we have told you, we restructured operations at Vector Tobacco and have ceased most


of Vector Tobacco’s research activities. Accordingly, we have determined to combine financial


reporting for Vector Tobacco into Liggett. As a result, comparisons to 2009 performance are


adjusted to reflect the combination of Vector Tobacco and Liggett.


For the three months ended March 31, 2010, Liggett revenues were 221.1 million compared to


121.2 million for the corresponding period in 2009. As Howard mentioned, the great majority of the


revenue increase in the quarter is due to the higher federal excise tax rate, which explains why the


incremental revenue is not dropping down to the bottom-line.


Operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was 34.9 million compared to 35.6


million for the corresponding period in 2009. Included in the year ago period’s operating income is


the one-time gain of $5 million related to the 1999 trademark transaction with Philip Morris and


restructuring charges of 1 million.


Overall, according to Management Science Associates, first quarter retail shipments for the industry


declined by 9.3%. During the same period, Liggett’s retail shipments increased by almost 19%. All


of the larger competitors suffered significant declines in retail shipments except for Lorillard, which


data indicates had a modest increase of less than 1%.


Liggett’s first quarter retail growth has increased our industry market share to 3.4%, an eight-tenths


of an industry share point increase over the prior year period. This is the highest market share we


have had since 1991. As you may recall, in anticipation of the April 1, 2009 federal excise tax


increase, there was a deloading of industry inventory at both wholesale and retail. By far the


greater impact was at wholesale, where higher inventory levels are maintained. Under any


circumstances, retail shipments tend to be more stable and we believe serve as a better indicator of


company performance.
