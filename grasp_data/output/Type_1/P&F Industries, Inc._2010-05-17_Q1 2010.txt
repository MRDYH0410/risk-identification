conference call. I'd like to begin this call with a brief update on certain facts and
 
events involving our company of

which I and an unrelated third party jointly led the company on a subordinated bases
. We are continuing our


efforts to obtain new financing as well as new mortgages on our three properties to replace the current mortgages


so we have. Further we're having discussions as I just said, to discuss our perhaps our machinery and equipment
