MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008


eMagin Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tanya, and I will be your coordinator for


today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question and answer


session towards the end of today’s conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder ladies and


gentlemen, this conference is being recorded.


I would now like to turn the presentation over to Paul Campbell, Interim CFO of eMagin. Sir, please


go ahead.


Paul C. Campbell, Interim Chief Financial Officer


Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us on eMagin Corporation’s fourth quarter and


full year 2008 conference call.


Before we begin, I would like to remind all of you that we will be referring to numbers that are part


of our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and that during today’s call we may make


forward-looking statements as they are defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of


1995. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations,


projections, beliefs, estimates and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.


Such statements include reference projections of future revenues, plans for product development


and production, the Company’s ability to ramp-up production at its manufacturing facilities, future


contracts and commercial arrangements, future product benefits, future operations, liquidity and


capital resources, as well as statements containing words like believes, expects, estimate, plan,


anticipate, target, will, intend, seek, could, would and other similar expressions.


Risk factors are included in the Company’s Form 10-K report from 2008 on file with the Securities


and Exchange Commission. Except if it’s directly required by the federal securities laws, we


undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a


result of new information, future events, changes in circumstances or any other reason.


Okay. I would now like to introduce Andrew Sculley, President and CEO of eMagin Corporation.


Andrew G. Sculley, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter and year-end 2008 conference call. 2008 was a


year of significant achievement and considerable momentum at eMagin. Thanks to refocusing of


the Company on the design and manufacture of microdisplays, we were able to reduce costs,


improve production processes and grow our sales to a broader customer base.


The progress made by the Company in each of the past three quarters was perhaps most evident


in the fourth quarter when eMagin achieved a major milestone by posting the second consecutive


profitable quarter in the Company’s history. Net income totaled a record $576,000 in fourth quarter


2008, following net income of $361,000 in the third quarter. It is also significant that the Company


was able to retire $6 million of debt during the fourth quarter and enter 2009 with no long-term debt


on its balance sheet.


Our stronger financial position and positive cash flow from operations will help us fund our two


phase capital investment plan which is expected to bring about the extension of production lines,


expansion of capacity and additional yield improvements in future periods.

I’ll turn it back over to Paul to go through the financial results in detail. Paul?


Paul C. Campbell, Interim Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Andrew. During our most recent call in November, we mentioned that we expected


revenue for the fourth quarter would be approximately 4.5 to 5.5 million and we were able to meet


that expectation, posting quarterly revenue of more than $5 million for the third consecutive quarter.


Actual revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 5.3 million representing a 15% increase over 4.6


million for the same period in 2007. Earlier last year, we also reported that we expected to exceed


2008 full year revenue, even though 2007 was more than double the total revenue reported in


2006. We were able to deliver those results. Full year 2008 revenue totaled 18.7 million


representing a 6% increase over 2007.


Our production and R&D teams continued to improve the manufacturing process for OLED


microdisplays. These process improvements are reflected in the 15 point gain in gross margin in


2008 compared to 2007. In fourth quarter, the gross margin was a record 51% compared to 28% in


2007, a very strong 23 percentage point increase.


Operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2009 were 1.9 million, down from 2 million in fourth


quarter 2007. The lower operating expenses are primarily due to cost reductions implemented by


management. Operating income for fourth quarter 2008 totaled $783,000 compared to an operating


loss of $903,000 in fourth quarter of 2007.


Fourth quarter cash flow was EBITDA positive by $907,000. This was our third consecutive quarter


of positive operating income and cash flow.


Net income for the fourth quarter 2008 was $576,000 or $0.04 per share as compared to a loss of


$1.2 million, or $0.09 per share in 2007. The Company significantly reduced its net loss to 1.9


million for the full year 2008 after posting a net loss of 18.5 million in the prior year.


I’ll now turn it back over to Andrew Sculley for some additional remarks.


Andrew G. Sculley, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Paul. As you have just heard and can judge based on our financial results, eMagin’s


performance continues to improve. The Company has combined a rich portfolio of intellectual


property and know how developed during the past 10 years with recent gains in efficiency to


establish a proprietary manufacturing process that is both profitable and scalable. We move into


2009 with a strong pipeline of microdisplay products that we are able to produce in volume and


better able to meet the demand requirements of large military contracts and a growing consumer


market.


We have well over 100 customers around the world that have commercialized eMagin-equipped


products or are at various stage of product development. These represent a diverse variety of


industrial, medical, military and consumer applications.


Our growing portfolio of OLED microdisplays deliver high resolution, flicker-free images which work


effectively in adverse conditions such as extreme temperatures and high vibrations with extremely


high power efficiency. Our SVGA+ Rev3 display, which we demonstrated at the 2008 Society for


Information Display Conference, offers the most power-efficient OLED solution for near-eye


personal viewer applications. And our SXGA which is beginning production is four times more


power efficient than any competitive SXGA display. We believe this display will prove to be an


easy-to-integrate solution for many virtual imaging systems.
