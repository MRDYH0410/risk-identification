The agenda for today's call is as follows. First, Ms. Frangou will offer opening remarks. Next, Mr. Petrone will provide an operational update and an industry overview. Mr. Karyotis will go through an overview including recent financials for Navios South American Logistics, then Mr. Achniotis will review Navios Holdings' financial results. Lastly, we'll open the call to take your questions.

And now let's turn the call over to Navios Holdings Chairman and CEO, Ms. Angeliki Frangou. Angeliki?

Thank you, Laura, and good morning to all of you joining us on today's call. We are pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. We had a solid quarter in a challenging market environment. We reported $206 million of EBITDA which includes a number of one-off items. George Achniotis will be discussing with later in some detail.

I believe that Navios Holdings is poised to capture any upturn in the market. During the past few years, as the maritime industry experienced distress, we focused our energy on controlling that which we could. Today, we not only have an excellent cost control and superb technical management capabilities, we also have a strong balance sheet. As a result, we continue returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payment and declare a $0.06 dividend for the fourth quarter to shareholders of record on March 20, 2013.

Slide 2 shows our current corporate structure and the value of Navios Holdings is primarily derived from four areas; the drybulk fleet within Navios Holdings and three principal operating subsidiaries. The whole continues to be valued at less than the sum of its parts. As of the close of business last Friday, Navios Holdings common share was valued at $3.84 per share. This means the market is valuing Navios Holdings core fleet of 48 vessels and Navios Logistics at less than $95 million. This seems to miss the mark as we believe the value of our interest in Navios Logistics alone is greater than that.

For 2012, Navios Logistics reported almost $50 million of EBITDA. Ioannis Karyotis, the CFO, will address shortly. EBITDA on Navios Logistics has grown at 21.7% compounded annual growth rate for the past few years. Navios Logistics' experienced management team is addressing the market opportunity and has transformed Navios Logistics into a key provider in the Hidrovia region of South America. In our view, if you assign any reasonable multiple, you can see that Navios Logistics is worth way more than $95 million and this analysis does not include the 48 vessels that are owned directly by Navios Holdings.

Slide 3 gives you the result of our strategy from 2012. We begin 2013 with a conservative balance sheet. We have only 42% leverage ratio with a $352.6 million of liquidity. Of this, $282.6 million is in cash. Given our focus on controlling cost during the past few years, we have managed to substantially reduce our cash breakeven. For example, if you compare 2012 to 2010, you will see that we have reduced average breakeven cost by 16%. We have reduced our breakeven cost by 8% comparing 2012 to 2011.

Controlling cost is an ongoing process. It is something that we have developed as a core value of Navios Holdings. It is part of our DNA, a very important part [indiscernible] (05:08) long period of fiscal 2012. At the peak of the market during the period of 2006 through 2008, we saw a push on long-term charter revenue from quality counterparties. This is supposed to be right strategy in light of the subsequent market collapse. Now, five years after the market correction, we have 46.8% fixed for 2013 and 8.6% for 2014. We believe that the increase in open days is recurring as the cycle is turning.

We know that we will not cut this term perfectly, but the open days are an outgrowth of our strategy to fix long-term charges when the market rate is justified and be patient when the market is less robust. If our estimates are correct, then we should be able to fix vessels into an improving chartered market.

We are also pleased to say that we have reduced our G&A by 12% or $6 million annually as a result of terminating our credit insurance for new charters. These savings will drop right down to our bottom line without an adverse impact on our operations. We have no unfunded acquisition commitment in our material debt maturities until 2017.

The cash, as a result, we have continued access to financing. In 2012, we successfully accessed the debt capital market by adding $88 million of additional 8 7/8% ship mortgage notes due in 2017. Additionally, we obtained further bank financing as we finance the acquisition of Navios Serenity and we finance existing debt for Navios Astra.

Slide 4 summarizes our credit default insurance. Navios Holdings restructured its credit default insurance at the request of the insurer which are independently determined to stop providing credit default insurance to the maritime space. The net result is that today, Navios Holdings is stronger. Navios Holdings received a large upfront cash payment and continues to benefit from the insurance.

As a result of the [ph] restruction, (07:35) Navios received $242.1 million in compensation. This was composed by $175.4 million cash payment and $25.5 million of net present value cash benefit a $41.2 million of continued credit default insurance. In sum, under the old insurance policy, we had about $207 million of credit default insurance coverage. Today, we received value of $242.1 million representing net of the $20 million supplemental coverage to Navios Partners more than 107% of its original coverage.

In the existing low chartered rate environment, credit default insurance for the new charter is not commercially viable. So, we will internally manage the credit risk. The biggest benefit to Navios Holdings is that we now have the upside market potential from the defaulted charter. Given current market conditions, we want this upside potential.

Previously, the insurer received any upside from the chartering of vessels emanating from the default. Now, all such excess will be retained by Navios Holdings. Navios Holdings estimated with an annually $3.3 million for every $1,000 per day and above the mitigating rates.

Slide 5 shows our strong liquidity position and net debt to book capitalization is 42% at the end of 2012, reflecting an 880 basis points reduction from the end of 2011. In addition, we had a liquidity of $352.6 million of which $282.6 million was cash.

Slide 6 speaks for the Navios' cash breakeven after the restructured credit default insurance. Turning first to the cost side, we have a cash breakeven of $13,600 per day in 2013. Our revenue per day adjusted for the $175 million payment accelerated to 2012 is $13,411 per day in 2013 and $25,595 for 2014.

The materials business between the two years is a number of open days. Navios Holdings has 46.8% of available days for 2013 versus 8.6% in 2014. This analysis includes all operating expenses, drydocking expenses, charter-in expenses for charter-in fleet, G&A including credit default insurance fees as well as interest expense and capital repayments. I also wanted to say that we provided this conservative analysis to demonstrate that we are confident for the future.

The sum of our competitive position is as follows. We believe that we are the preferred commercial partner for industry participants. Our balance sheet is strong and we have demonstrated a historical ability and willingness to honor our obligations. Consequently, potential commercial partners understand that they can engage with us with the comfort that we will provide reliable service. Charterers can secure a long-term contract with a security that will not be [ph] blocked (11:19) by either technical nor commercial issues. Supplier can provide equipment [indiscernible] (11:25) with the understanding that we will be providing fair compensation.

And with this, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ted Petrone, Navios President, who will take us on Navios operations and our industry perspective. Ted?

Thank you, Angeliki, and good morning all. Please turn to slide 7. Our long-term core fleet consists of 48 vessels totaling 5.1 million deadweight. We have 44 vessels in the water with an average age of six years.

Please to turn to slide 8. Post the restructuring agreement with our credit default insurer, Navios's average charter-out rate for its core fleet is $13,411 a day for 2013 and $25,595 a day for 2014. 46.8% of Navios fleet is chartered-out for 2013 and 8.6% for 2014.

As depicted on the left side of slide 8, the white portion of the bars represents pre-insurance restructuring levels. The differentials in the charter-out rate in contracted days reflect the changes as a result of the acceleration of charter payments through the $175.4 million lump sum payment in the credit default insurer. This payment enhances our balance sheet and cash on hand.

Please turn to slide 9. We enjoy vessel operating expenses about 24% below the industry average in all asset classes. Navios's current daily OpEx is $4,335 a day. This $1,337 a day savings per vessel in operating expenses aggregates to over $14 million in annual savings which goes directly to our bottom line.

The right-hand chart reflects the changes in the daily charter-out rates for the ships we have on long-term chart before and after the lump sum payment from the credit default insurer. We continue to enjoy good relations with these owners which allow Navios to expand the fleet without capital expense.

Please turn to slide 10. An oversupply of tonnage and continued economic weakness in 2012 contributed to the BDI ending the year below 700, while also reaching the lowest yearly average since 1986. In the early part of this year, a combination of seasonal weather-related disruptions and industrial actions brought about a steady decline in drybulk trade. This, accompanied by a temporary acceleration of newbuilding deliveries, pushed the BDI to its lowest January on record of 771 points. As a result, scrapping, so far in 2013, has been about the same pace of 2012.

Going forward, China seems to have returned to growth, meeting or exceeding their stated 7.5% goal. Fuel prices are showing signs of recovery and then power generation is up year-on-year. China is expected to deemphasize domestic iron ore production in favor of iron ore imports, which should support the Capesize in vessels.

Please turn to slide 11. World GDP continues to be driven by developing economies. Developing economies now contribute a higher percentage of total world growth than the developed economies, representing over half of the global consumption of most commodities. Emerging economies are projected to grow at 5.5% in 2013 and at 5.9% in 2014. Chinese economic growth is projected at 8.2% in 2013 and 8.5% in 2014.

Turning to slide 12, the primary engines of trade growth continued to be China and India with other emerging countries adding strong growth. Drybulk trade has expanded by an average of 5.4% per year in the last decade since China joined the WTO. Consensus forecast for 2013 are for global drybulk trade to grow approximately 5% and ton-mile growth of about 7%. A similar growth rate is estimated for net fleet growth leading to a balanced supply/demand dynamics.

Turning to slide 13, currently just over 50% of the world's population resides at urban areas. That figure is expected to grow by 67% by 2015, adding approximately 2.8 billion urban residents with a large portion of urbanization occurring in the Asia Pacific regions. The U.S. National Intelligence Council said in the December report that due to this rapid urbanization in the developing world, the volume of construction for housing, offices, and transport over the next 40 years could roughly equal the entire volume of such construction to date in world history. This will drive raw material demand over that period.

As you can see on the right-hand graph, growth in income supports increased metal demand. The rise in global incomes and the shift in the global economy towards Asia should support world bulk trade by increasing movements of raw materials as shipping patterns adjust to the new global model.

Moving to slide 14, development and urbanization of the western and central parts of China will continue to significantly [indiscernible] (16:25) consumption in 2013 and onwards. In construction, housing construction and consumer spending growth will underpin development in 2013 and beyond. Underlying this trend is a continued expansion of the Yangtze River cargo traffic which reached another record of 1.8 billion tons prior to 2012.

Crude steel production in China in 2012 was about 5% more than 2011. In order to support this growth, China imported 745 million tons of iron ore, 9% more than 2011. A particular to note is that the imports increased 9% in 2012, while domestic ore production was stagnant at about a 1% increase year-on-year. This trend seems to be continuing in 2013.

The current substitution of imported iron ore for low-quality domestic production is expected to continue and will increase the tons carried and ton miles. The chart on the upper right shows estimated new iron ore mining capacity from Australia and Brazil graphed against the expected decline of domestic Chinese iron ore mining.

Turning to slide 15, low freight, very expensive fuel, and high ship scrap prices led to record scrapping of 33.7 million deadweight tons in 2012. Scrapping rates for older, less fuel efficient vessels have continued at very high rates this year. February 15, about 3.7 million deadweight tons have been scrapped similar to last year's pace. If this trend continues, scrapping should once again reach over 30 million deadweight tons in 2013.

The current rate environment should continue to incur scrapping as over 6.4% of the fleet is 25 years of age or over and over 12% of the fleet is over 20 years of age providing about 86 million deadweight tons of scrapping potential. Demolition prices are purely dependent on fuel prices not on vessel supply.

Moving to slide 16, 2012 newbuilding deliveries totaled a record 98 million deadweight tons against an expected 130 million deadweight tons. As of the case in 2011, non-deliveries amounted to 30%, bringing 2012 net fleet growth to about 10.3%. Very early indications for 2013 show non-delivery rate is higher than 2012.

Net fleet additions this year are expected to be lower than last year with over 60% of the deliveries expected in the first half. This means that net fleet growth should balance with the expected ton-mile increase in demand during the second half of this year. The order book declines dramatically in 2014 and beyond and expected to remain in that way as banks continue severe restrictions on newbuilding loans.

Turning to slide 17, slide 17 provides a retrospective of the rate environment and considers the impact of supply/demand equilibrium on a rate recovery for 2013. As we all know, for any rate recovery to be meaningful and lasting, the supply and demand factors must be such that fleet growth rates fall below trade growth rates.

As we all can now see, global GDP is projected to increase in 2013 and 2014 at 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, from the more subdued rates in 2011 and 2012. To-date, the improvement has been moderate. However, the rate of change suggests that the drybulk trade will expand in 2013 for the following reasons. First, newbuild deliveries continue to decelerate and non-deliveries have been about 30% or greater for the past four years. For 2013, newbuilding deliveries are projected to be about 70 million deadweight tons assuming the non-deliveries remain at 30%.

Second, we are witnessing a continued high scrapping rate. For 2012 to 2012, 4.2% and 5.5% of the fleets scrapped. Indeed, the projections for the supply/demand balance of the fleet for 2013 revolve around the projections for scrapping.

As you could see from the bar on the right, we note that the net demand may be positive 30 basis points, the first positive indication we've had in five years. However, others note that it may be a minus 1.3%. It seems that the projectionists did not agree on the level of scrapping with the projection ranging from 24 million deadweight to 40 million deadweight.

In sum, we note that for the first time in four years, there is a possibility that net demand will exceed supply. Consequently, rate levels should pick up during the course of 2013. We know these conditions are not evident over the past three years.

Turning to slide 18, we currently own 23.4% of Navios Partners, including a 2% GP interest. Navios Partners operates a fleet of 21 vessels equaling 2.3 million deadweight with an average age of 6.2 years. Since its inception in 2007, Navios Partners' fleet has grown by 261%.

Please turn to slide 19. Navios Partners provides significant cash flow to Navios Holdings. Since its start of operations, Navios Partners has grown distributions by almost 27% and we received about 106 million distributions from Partners. In 2013 we expect to receive about $29.4 million in distributions. This is about 119% of holdings expected annual dividend. Including Navios Maritime's acquisition dividends, Navios Holdings received about 140% of its expected annual dividend from its ownership in these two companies.

Please turn to slide 20. We have an approximate 55% economic interest in Navios Maritime Acquisition. Navios Acquisition's current fleet consists of 29 tanker vessels totaling 3.3 million deadweight. Navios Acquisition currently has 21 vessels in the water with an average age of 4.9 years. We anticipate that Navios Acquisition's newbuilding program for product tankers positions itself to take advantage of favorable long-term industry dynamics.

Please turn to slide 21. Navios Acquisition is summarized on slide 21. It has a large, modern and diverse tanker fleet worth more than $1 billion. Navios Acquisition has long-term contracted revenue that is well above the company's low operating breakeven. Its cash flow can sustain Navios Acquisition for a long period in uncertain market conditions.

Navios Acquisition has profit sharing arrangements in many contracts. These agreements limit the downside risk to the base rate and allow Navios Acquisition to enjoy the upside volatility. For example, in 2012, profit sharing has been triggered in all asset classes. These conditions and the growth of the fleet have led to a 31% increase in EBITDA in 2012.

Please turn to slide 22. Navios Acquisition is positioned to capture any strength in the tanker market. 80% of the entire fleet has profit sharing while over 83% of Navios Acquisition's product tanker fleet has profit sharing. During 2012, this profit sharing mechanism provided significant cash flow. Navios Acquisition earned $2 million incremental cash flow from profit sharing in 2012 or $0.05 per share. More than half of this amount or $1.1 million was earned from profit sharing in Q4.

Consequently, as a matter of policy, absent unusual circumstances, Navios Acquisition required profit sharing in the charter agreements. As a result of this policy, for every $1,000 of profit share above the base rate, Navios Acquisition earns $5.4 million in free cash flow. This equates to about $0.13 per common share on an annualized basis.

Please turn to slide 23. This slide demonstrates how Navios Acquisition's newbuild deliveries are increasing EBITDA and building cash flow. Since 2011, available days have grown by 43% and the fleet has grown by 36%. EBITDA has grown by 26% in 2012 over 2011 and will continue to grow as NNA takes delivery of new vessels including the two vessels delivered in Q4 2012. And the two vessels in 2013 will add about $8.2 million of EBITDA to Navios Acquisition's run rate on an annualized basis.

This concludes my presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to Ioannis Karyotis, Senior VP of Strategic Planning. Ioannis?

Thank you, Ted. Slides 24 and 25 provide an overview of Navios Logistics. Navios Holdings owns 63.8% stake in Navios South American Logistics. Navios Logistics has three segments, all enjoying significant growth prospects.

As you can see on slide 26, for the past three years, revenues have grown at a 14.6% compounded annual growth rate. At the same time, EBITDA has grown at 21.7% compounded annual growth rate from $32.5 million in 2010 to $48.1 million in 2012. In 2012, our port terminal generated 49% of EBITDA while barge and cabotage businesses contribute 27% and 24%, respectively.

Our dry port in Uruguay has total storage capacity of 460,000 metric tons, 99% of which has been contracted for a period of five years. The construction of a second conveyor belt expected to double our vessel loading capacity is in progress and the new conveyor belt is expected to be completed in Q3 of this year.

We see strong demand for our [indiscernible] (26:01) services in our port terminal in Uruguay. Accordingly, we recently agreed to acquire an Uruguayan company that controls approximately 12 hectares of undeveloped land located in the Nueva Palmira free zone near our existing port. The agreed purchase price is $2 million and we plan on developing this land in expanding further our port operations.

Please turn to slide 27 to discuss the results for the fourth quarter and the year-end 2012. We had a solid fourth quarter. While revenue decreased by 12% compared to the same period last year to $58.6 million, EBITDA increased by 8% compared to Q4 of 2011 to $10.9 million. Looking into the segment, EBITDA of port terminals in the fourth quarter increased by 71% to $5 million attributed to higher profitability of both our ports in Uruguay and in Paraguay. The 16% decrease in revenue of port terminals is attributed to lower sales of liquid products in our port in Paraguay, a low margin activity that has a relatively low impact on EBITDA, but can affect revenue.

Revenue in the barge business decreased 15% and EBITDA decreased by 48% in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the same period last year. While our time charters and contracts of affreightment, with minimum volume of [indiscernible] (27:25) guarantees for iron ore transportation continue to perform well. Profitability was adversely affected by a decline in liquid cargo volumes. Cabotage business reported a 5% increase in revenue while EBITDA increased by 304% to $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $0.6 million in the same period of 2011 mainly due to improved efficiency in fleet operations.

Interest expense and finance cost net were $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to $5.1 million in the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $6.9 million as compared to $6 million in Q4 of 2011. Our net result for the quarter was a net loss of $0.7 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million in the respective period last year.

Turning to the full year of 2012, revenue increased by 5% to $247 million. EBITDA grew 23% to $48.1 million driven by the port terminals and the barge business segments. Interest expense and finance cost net were $20.1 million compared to $17.1 million in 2011 due to the full year impact of interest expense generated by the senior notes issued in April 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $26.9 million from $22.6 million 2011. As a result, net income was $0.2 million compared to net loss of $0.2 million last year.

Please turn to slide 28. Slide 28 provides select balance sheet data as of year-end 2012. Navios Logistics has a strong balance sheet. At the end of 2012, cash and cash equivalents were $45.5 million compared to $40.5 million at the end of 2011. Net debt to book capitalization was 33%, down from 35% at the end of 2011.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to George Achniotis, Navios Holdings Chief Financial Officer. George?

Thank you, Ioannis, and good morning all. Please turn to slide 29 for a review of the full year and fourth quarter 2012 financial highlights. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that for comparability purposes, we are presenting the consolidated results of 2011 on a pro forma basis to exclude the effect of Navios acquisition which was deconsolidated at the end of Q1 2011.

Revenue for the quarter decreased to approximately $128 million compared to $168 million in Q4 2011. The reduction is mainly attributable to the accounting for the settlement of the credit default insurance whereby revenues attributable to defaulted charters that were previously being allocated over the duration of those charters are now shown as one-off in other income.

Paradoxically, these amounts are included in EBITDA so we have the strange results of an accounting treatment where EBITDA for the quarter is higher than revenue. As Ioannis explained earlier, revenue from the logistics business also reduced compared to Q4 last year mainly due to a reduction in the volume of oil products sold at the port in Paraguay.

EBITDA for the quarter increased from $64 million in Q4 2011 to $206 million in 2012. The increase is mainly attributable to the $161 million net gain shown in other income from restructuring the credit default insurance. As Ioannis just mentioned, Navios Logistics also contributed higher EBITDA in Q4 2012 compared to Q4 2011.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $147 million compared to $12 million in 2011. The increase is mainly attributable to the increase in EBITDA during the period and it was mitigated by an increase in interest expense due to the $88 million add on to the Navios Holdings bond issued in July of 2012, higher depreciation due to additions in the assets of both Navios Holdings and Logistics and a one-off charge of $4 million representing accelerated amortization of intangibles due to the earlier delivery of three long-term chartering vessels.

Turning to the full year results, EBITDA increased from $246 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $390 million in 2012. This has also been positively affected by the restructuring of the credit default insurance in Q4 of 2012. EBITDA was also positively affected by the significant increase in the results of Navios Logistics whose EBITDA increased by over 23% from $39 million in 2011 to $48 million in 2012.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased to $166 million from $42 million the previous year. The main reason for the increase was the restructuring of the insurance. The increase was mitigated by a $9 million increase in interest expense due to $88 million additional bonds issued by Navios Holdings in 2012 and the full-year impact of the two bonds issued in 2011 by Navios Holdings and Navios Logistics. Net income was also negatively affected by higher depreciation due to the addition of assets in both Navios Holdings and Logistics and the accelerated amortization of intangibles.

Please turn now to slide 30 where the key balance sheet highlights are presented. The cash balance as of December 31, 2012 increased to over $283 million compared to $177 million at the end of December 2011. The substantial increase is due to the lump sum cash received for restructuring the credit default insurance.

The majority of the cash received reflects undiscounted future cash flows from defaulted charters. The balance on deposits for vessel acquisitions was eliminated and so all newbuilding vessels delivered during the year and there are no outstanding CapEx commitments.

Long-term debt including the current portion, but excluding senior notes, reduced significantly from $508 million at the end of December 2011 to $324 million to the end of December 2012. The reduction is in line with our steady strategy to de-lever and strengthen the balance sheet in order to be able to weather the [ph] kind (34:07) distressed market and take advantage of distressed transactions that may become available.

Senior notes increased by $88 million during the year following the issuance of the add-on to the 2017 secured senior notes in July of 2012. Despite the prolonged period of depressed rates and vessel values in the drybulk market, our net debt to book capitalization ratio reduced significantly to 42% from 51% at the end of December 2011. Finally, I would like to note that we were in compliance with all our debt covenants at the end of the year.

Turning to slide 31, the company continues to pay its dividend uninterrupted by market conditions. A dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012 of $0.06 a share was declared to shareholders on record on March 20 to be paid on March 27. This represents a dividend yield of 6.3% based on Friday's share price.

I would also like to point out that the total annualized cash dividend inflows from our ownership with Navios Partners and Navios Acquisition is approximately $34 million. This exceeds the annual dividend paid out by Navios Holdings to shareholders by $9 million.

This concludes my review of the financials. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Angeliki for closing remarks. Angeliki?

Thank you, George. This completes the formal presentation. We'll open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]

Your first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

Hi, thanks. Everyone, good morning.

Good morning, Chris.

Good morning.

I guess, I wanted to start on the strategy and you mentioned a lot of that, the potential for some rate recovery as you move out into 2014. You obviously have a lot of open days. When do you start the fixing process assuming that we don't see much move in rates through the better part of 2013? Is it something where you just keep on kind of shorter, call it, six-month or so type of agreements until you start to see some inflection? Yes, I guess I just wanted to get a sense of how you think about the strategy of approaching all of those open days for 2014.

First of all, Chris, the reality is that you should not see the world with a Q1 BDI and the market – the Chinese New Year's market. I think that is always seasonally low. Most of our days are open days, [ph] 1,000 (36:53) days is in the second half of the year. About over 5,000 days in Handymax which is the most stable of the sizes. It was about 1,500 on the Panamax and 1,300 for Cape.

So, with these days and Capes being only on the Q4, so seasonally a strong quarter. If we have on these days – 2012 was a weak market. If at the same market this year that we had last year, the company will not [ph] forecast (37:29) and actually have been in a very good shape. So, you realized that we can – if you see the [ph] averages (37:35) and where we are, we feel very comfortable and at the same time, we're sitting on $285 million of cash. That gives us ability to withstand any market condition and secondly, to invest in global company in an environment that we see very opportune.

I don't know if you notice the slides that Ted was mentioning in page 17. I mean, if you take the net should grow and the drybulk demand grows, with any estimate of the analysts, we are at a turning point here so we believe that, okay, you may have models, new deliveries, lopsided about 60% coming in the first half and 40% in the second half so rebalancing on the second half, but we see that this market is ripe for a reversal. And now the indicator to that is a volume of vessel sales and even in low levels, we have seen there is quite significant pick up of the volume. That indicates that we are maybe in an inflection point.

Okay. That certainly is helpful. It gives us some sense of how to think about it. And then you mentioned the cash balance. Well, how do you think about uses for cash? Is it the kind of thing that you might want to hold on to for a quarter or two and see how the market develops before you make any real decisions there or is there anything of particular interest that maybe could come up before that time?

As I mentioned, there's still major shortage of vessels except the open market that exists in the bank that we see that are also right. But also I think a very important market that is opening up is the Japanese market as the yen has substantially moved up, down so it weakens that will free up vessels and we'll be able to transact at 80 – one day [ph] end (39:36) it was 80. They could not do any transaction. They will have booked tremendous losses. With, again, moving at 94 last night, you know that this is a market that will also become open for transaction and an area where Navios had traditionally very strong relationships, and also, it provides a very quality [indiscernible] (40:00)

Okay. So that could be where you might see some activity. Great. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the time.

Thank you, Chris.
