MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the CTG Conference


Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer


session. [Operator Instructions].


And we are recording today’s call. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Debbie


Pawlowski. Please go ahead.


Deborah Pawlowski, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Kent. And good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your interest


in CTG. Joining us on the call today are CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt; and Senior Vice


President and Chief Financial Officer, Brendan Harrington. Jim and Brendan are going to review


the results for the first quarter of 2009 and update you on the company’s strategy and outlook. We’ll


follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing our financial


results, you can access it at the company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected. Additional information concerning factors that could cause


actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statement is contained in our earnings


release as well as the company’s SEC filings. You can find those at our website or the SEC’s


website at www.sec.gov. So please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these


precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion.


James R. Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Debbie. And good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us


this morning for our first quarter earnings conference call. As you saw in our earnings release, once


again, we’re at the high end of our guidance for both revenue and earnings per share. Expanded


margins from our new solutions combined with quick and aggressive cost management to offset the


current economic environment’s impact on our earnings.


I’m going to talk more about our business and what we see for the rest of the year. But first, I’m


going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting


Officer


Thanks, Jim. Good morning. For the first quarter of 2009, CTG reported improved operating


margins and EPS stability on lower revenue. Revenue was 74.6 million, a decrease of 12.1 million


or 14%, compared with the first quarter of 2008.


Despite lower revenue, operating income remained unchanged at 2.4 million, largely as a result of


an increase in revenue from recently introduced higher margin offerings coupled with disciplined


cost management. These factors also drove the year-over-year 50-basis point increase in our


operating margin to 3.2% of revenue.

Net income in the quarter declined 7.3% to 1.3 million from 1.4 million in the first quarter of 2008.


The 2009 first quarter included 0.1 million of net of tax loss from foreign currency exchange on


inner subsidiary borrowings. On a per diluted share basis, net income was flat at $0.09 in both the


2009 and 2008 first quarters.


Solutions revenue was 24.2 million or 32% of total revenue, an 18.1% decline from last year’s first


quarter. Total staffing services revenue was 50.4 million, down 11.9% in the quarter. Staffing


represented 68% of total revenue.


IBM, our largest customer, provided us 19.1 million of revenue in the quarter compared with 27.3


million in the first quarter of 2008. As a percentage of total revenue, IBM was down to 25.6% in the


2009 first quarter compared with 31.4% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was 17.7 million, a 6.9% decrease from the 19 million


recorded in last year’s first quarter. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, European revenue in


the quarter would have increased by 7.7% over last year. Direct cost as a percentage of revenue


were 77.6% in the first quarter, down from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2008, but flat with the trailing


fourth quarter of 2008.


Both the 2009 and 2008 first quarter’s results include equity compensation expense of


approximately $0.01 per diluted share net of tax. The tax rate for the 2009 first quarter was 42.3%


compared with 39.8% in the 2008 first quarter.


We expect the tax rate for the full year 2009 to be between 41 and 43%. We had approximately


2700 employees at the end of the first quarter 2009, of which approximately 88% are billable


resources. On the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding was 58 days compared with 57 days at


the end of 2008 and was 60 days at the end of the first quarter of 2008.


Our cash used in operations in the first quarter was approximately 0.4 million as compared with 0.3


million in the first quarter of 2008. We had 842,000 of capital expenditures focused mostly on


solutions development and we recorded depreciation expense of 433,000 in the quarter.


CTG’s financial position remains very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 8


million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt outstanding on our $35 million revolving credit


agreement in place through April 2011. That was especially notable because the first quarter ended


on a payroll date.


During the first quarter of 2009, while adhering to SEC imposed volume limitations, we repurchased


173,000 shares of CTG common stock. During this most recent self-imposed blackout period prior


to releasing earnings we repurchased shares under our 10b5-1 plan.


At this time, our repurchase authorization is for approximately 1.1 million shares. We believe CTG’s


shares remain undervalued at recent prices and intend to continue our repurchase program through


the remainder of 2009. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Brendan. In the current economic environment, we’re pleased that despite a 14% decline


in revenue, CTG maintained earnings per share at the same level as last year due to our margin


expansion and financial discipline.


In aggregate, our solutions business declined by 18.1% in the first quarter of 2009. As we reported


on the February conference call, the tight credit markets have negatively impacted demand for our


solutions business, particularly from the healthcare provider market. Not for profit hospitals finance
