Thank you, Steven. At this time, we would like to open up for Q&A session. Please note that with Chinese-speaking participants, you can also do the Q&A in Mandarin and we'll provide translation. [Foreign Language] (00:20:01-00:20:14) Operator, please.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lingxin Kong from CICC. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:21:19-00:21:36)

[Foreign Language] (00:21:38)

[Foreign Language] (00:21:41-00:22:59)

[Foreign Language] (00:23:00-00:23:12)

[Foreign Language] (00:23:13-00:23:45)

Xie xie. The first question is focused on the gross margin for the fiscal year 2018, and we could see the integrated contract gross margin from 28% raised to 33%. And beyond – the reason is that the mix of the different products, is there any other reasons for this matter? And also we could see that Railway Transportation compared to IA, the gross margin is higher. But last fiscal year, for example, the Railway Transportation revenue goes down, but still from that point to now, we could see that IA compare increase a lot, but still the mix the gross margin maintain a high basement like this fiscal year, 38.2%, so just to give us our hint about the gross margin.

The second question is about the guidance for – there has no guidance for the fiscal year 2019 and could you give us a little bit more landscape about the future. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:25:05-00:26:29)

The first question about the gross margin and this fiscal year still making high basement. Beyond the mix reasons, we also have the other two reasons. The first one is Railway Transportation compare the percentage of total revenue contribution is still high and this part that the gross margin is higher than the other business. And also this fiscal year, the M&E business also the gross margin is improved – make a bigger improvement. So that's why the whole gross margin still maintain a good level.

And the second question about the guidance, the first thing we can see there are from technical – technically to predict one year a little bit hard for the current circumstances. For example, like that no matter external environment, the policy, the other things. And the second one is internally element because our current management team is thinking about the long-term strategy and some time for achieve long-term strategy or target, we would not concentrate on the short-term of the numbers. So that's the reason. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:27:57-00:28:13)

[Foreign Language] (00:28:15)

The question is about the high-speed Rail revenue, the percentage of this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year is increasing but could you provide the data about that part? And the answer is, currently, I have no data on hand but you can calculate by the financial result. Thank you.

Operator, next one.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line Varun Ginodia from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.

Hi. Hi, everyone. Thanks for the call. So, my question is we have recently seen CRC coming up with a blue sky plan. So, I wanted to get a sense from you what impact do you expect to see on HollySys from that particular plan in terms of train procurement going forward and how does that impact the new order contracts for your company? And also if you can, if it's possible to provide some guidance on new orders in second half of this year, like, second half calendar year 2018. What is your thoughts on that? Can we see increased procurement coming in and that getting translated into higher growth in new orders? Yeah, that would be it.

Okay. Thank you. [Foreign Language] (00:29:51-00:30:18)

[Foreign Language] (00:30:20-00:31:40)

Right now, the China Railway Corporation entered the reform of the structure and also operating things and that's why the bidding process be influenced by this aspect. And also you could see that the 2018 calendar year actual should be gathered the contract but a lot of bidding postponed to the second half of the calendar year. And that's why we think that the second half year performance better from the other, than the first half. For example, like the [indiscernible] (00:32:18) contract and we will sign a contract before September 30.

And also at the end of the year, no matter from the 200, or 300, the 300 still have some orders. And the 200 is under research and development of new models but at the end of this calendar year will be finished. But rather or not is open bidding at the end of this year or at the beginning of next calendar year is hard to make a prediction. So, concluded, I mean, it's hard to make a prediction of the bidding process, but we believe from the current information that the CRC want to enlarge the investment to RMB 800 billion for this calendar year. So, that's why we are positive for the orders, but the time line would be fluctuate. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Gary Cheung from Haitong Capital. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:33:41)

[Foreign Language] (00:33:41)

[Foreign Language] (00:33:44-00:34:29)

Thank you. The first question about the Industrial Automation from last three years to right now, the new contract is increasing very fast. So what about the future momentum, it can maintain this momentum? And the second question about the business trading conflicts between United States and China, how long will it go further, is there any influence from your customers side or how much it could be influenced, and from which aspects? And the third question is about gross margin. You said that M&E [indiscernible] (00:35:12) have a big step improvement about gross margin; is this sustainable and why? Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:35:21-00:37:02)

The first question is about the Industrial Automation, and this kind of increase because we internally spend in our management skill and also we focus on target more about the high end of the market. And also, this is including the recent intellectual projects emphasized by the Central Government and for their own enterprises. And through the improvement of management skill and capability, we believe we can maintain the momentum.

And the second question about the conflicts – business conflicts between China and the United States. The influence really have, but the more positive to us. For example, like raise the tax – the import tax about the DCS and PLC products from outside. And this is in fact good momentum for us to penetrate the market. And also, the Central Government to emphasize on the procurement that the local company – domestic companies should emphasize on the house-made IP and proprietary technology. That's why no matter from the procurement basic technology or products, we are all made by our house. So this is also good for us.

And the third question about Concord. Sorry, the third question about the gross margin for M&E. The last fiscal year that Concord some product raised cost, so lead to the whole gross margin down. And through our internal improvement and we strengthened the control about the project, and this fiscal year why the M&E recovered to a normal above 10% gross margin. And this is sustainable. Thank you.

Okay. [Foreign Language] (00:39:19-00:39:50) Xie xie.

The first question is about the – adding about the second – the trading conflicts. You raised the import tax for HollySys, but from the customers side, do you see any slowing down because from customers side there are more cautiously to do like in large production, like [ph] the alternatives (00:40:26). So, maybe it shows that slowing down by customer. And the second question about the Industrial Automation fourth quarter gross margin.

[Foreign Language] (00:40:37-00:41:03)

The first question about our customers side, we are doing the engineering product. Actually these products we're planning several years ago and that's why right now the costs will lead to influence not [indiscernible] (00:41:24) right now. So, we see – you have to see the future resets maybe the second half of the calendar year or next calendar year, we can see the influence. This is kind of delay about our business. And the second question?

[Foreign Language] (00:41:50-00:41:58)

The IA gross margin in the fourth quarter still maintained a good level, so no any shock wave influence. Thank you.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got a chance to raise your questions, we will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We look forward to speaking with you again in the near future. Thank you. Xie xie.

Xie xie.
