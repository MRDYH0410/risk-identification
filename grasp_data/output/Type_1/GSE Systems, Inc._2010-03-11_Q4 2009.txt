MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to the GSE Systems’ Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Year-End


2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to


turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Moran. Please go ahead, sir.


John V. Moran, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Welcome everyone to GSE’s 2009 year-end conference call. I’m John Moran, GSE’s


Chief Executive Officer. I’m joined here today with our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Hough.


Today’s call will begin with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and year-end 2009 financial


results, including much more detail on our disclosure today that we’ve recorded a reserve against


our outstanding receivable at the Emirates Simulation Academy project in the UAE, as well as for a


portion of the credit facility that Union National Bank in Abu Dhabi has extended to ESA.


That will be followed by an update and general outlook on our nuclear simulation, non-nuclear


simulation and training and services business sectors. We’ll conclude with some comments and a


general outlook for 2010, much like we did last year followed by time for any questions that you


might have.


But before we begin, I’d like to turn it over to Jeff to address the subject of the forward-looking


statements.


Jeffery G. Hough, Chief Financial Officer


This presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding the future performance of GSE


Systems, Inc. that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially,


including but not limited to, economic conditions, customer demands, increased competition in the


relevant market and others.


We refer you to the documents that the company files from time to time with the Securities and


Exchange Commission, such as the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports, which contain


additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ from its current expectations


and from the forward-looking statements made in this presentation.


John V. Moran, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Jeff. As noted in our press release, the company reported that revenue for the three


months ended December 31, 2009 was 11.1 million, a 32% increase from the revenue reported for


the three months ended December 31, 2008 of 8.4 million.


GSE reported an operating loss of $1,054,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to an


operating income of $140,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The net loss for the December 31, 2009


quarter was $2,159,000 or minus $0.11 per share on both a basic and diluted basis as compared to


a net loss of $69,000 or $0.00 per share on both a basic and diluted basis for the fourth quarter of


2009.


Excluding the effect of the ESA impairment charge and the establishment of the related reserves,


GSE would have reported operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $454,000 and a net


income of $214,000 or $0.01 per share on both a basic and diluted basis for the fourth quarter of

2009. GSE reported revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 of $40.1 million, a 38%


increase from the revenue reported for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 of $29 million.


In 2009, the company generated 29.1 million or 73% of our total revenue from nuclear simulation;


10.3 million or 25% of the total revenue from non-nuclear simulation, and 718,000 or 2% of the total


revenue from training and educational services. GSE reported operating income of $563,000 for the


12 months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to an operating loss of $12,000 for the 12


months ended December 31, 2008. The company incurred a net loss attributed to shareholders of


$797,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 or minus $0.05 per share on a basic and


diluted basis compared to a net loss of $690,000 or minus $0.04 per share on a basic and diluted


basis for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008.


Excluding the effect of the ESA impairment charge and the establishment of the related reserves,


the company would have generated operating income of 2.1 million, a net income of 1.6 million or


$0.09 per share on both the basic and diluted basis for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009.


During the second half of year, the company successfully completed financing, net proceeds of


$15.9 million, and as a result ended the year with $25 million cash and short-term investments.


The company continued throughout the year to have zero borrowings against its $6 million


revolving credit facility with the Bank of America. The 2009 loss caused us to violate two of the


financial covenants of the credit facility. However, Bank of America has already provided a written


waiver for the defaults. And again, we have no borrowings against this facility. GSE periodically


enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the


fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign denominated trade receivables.


The purpose and structure of the foreign currency derivatives GSE has entered into are designed to


protect the contract value in margins at the time the contracts are signed, and are not designed to


speculate on the direction of any currency up or down. For the three and 12 months ended


December 31, 2009, the company incurred a 33,000 and a 763,000 pre-tax non-cash gain


respectively on the change and fair value of its foreign exchange contracts. GSE’s backlog, as of


December 31, 2009, was approximately $54 million compared to $38.1 million at December 31,


2008. Backlog is defined as the remaining value of signed contracts and does not include any value


for contracts being negotiated or for contracts that have been signed since December 31, 2009.


Therefore, the backlog of $54 million does not include the expected total full value of the full scope


nuclear simulator currently being built for Westinghouse Electric Company’s Haiyang project in


China. What’s important to understand is that we’ve been authorized to work on this project and


we’re booking revenue on the initial phases of this work no differently than any other project. To


characterize the contract backlog of $54 million a little bit further, 82% or roughly $43.5 million is in


our nuclear simulation business sector. 16% or roughly 9.1 million is in our non-nuclear simulation


sector and 2% or roughly 1.3 million is in our training services sector.


Okay, now I’d like to address the ESA project and our rational for taking the charges. First, I’ll


provide a brief overview of the project with the intent to provide some perspective. On November 8,


2005, the Emirates Simulation Academy LLC, or what we’re referring to as ESA for short,


headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates was formed to build and operate simulation


training academies in the Arab Gulf region.


These simulation training centers were envisioned to train and certify indigenous workers for


deployment to critical infrastructure facilities including power plants, oil refineries, petrochemical


plants, desalination units and other industrial facilities. The members of the limited liability company


include Al Qudra Holding of the United Arab Emirates with a 60% ownership position, the Center of


Excellence for Applied Research and Training of the United Arab Emirates with a 30% ownership


position and GSE with a 10% ownership position.
