Thank you, Arden, and greeting to everyone. I would like to discuss some key events during this quarter. Industrial automation recorded a 20% year-to-year growth in quarterly revenue at $45.7 million and a 55.6% year-to-year growth in quarterly contract, at $82.2 million.

Management's low-to-high end market expansion strategy has led to a healthy contract growth, especially in chemical and petrochemical. Contracts covered a broad range of products, such as DCS, SIS, DEH, MES and AMS, et cetera. Several major contracts were signed such as providing system for Henan Kelong Group, Shanxi Guangda Coking on their energy management project, and Zhong'an lianhe Coalification Company on their methanol and olefin conversion project.

We are also building comprehensive capacity to address the substantial service and upgrading potential from the entire customer base. On coal fire, while maintaining our market share in the high-end market, we have been actively responding to demand on environmental protection, energy saving, control optimization and information security, et cetera. Similar demand has also been spotted in other industries. With our widespread national service network, we are capable of communicating with and delivering to our customers from various industries regular and value-added [ph] customization (00:05:44) services and products they need.

In Factory automation, we adhered to our demonstration-for-further-application strategy and proceeded deeper in the cooperation with our current customer base. On food beverage, we continued to provide innovative solution to address safety and efficiency issues for Haidilao, with new projects covering automatic dish serving, dipping source making and smart cleaning. Management team will continue to seek strategic cooperation with more renowned customers to address the increasing demand from discrete automation. With product sales and customized solutions already being delivered for the time being, our team is also making effort to get Hollysys' product line more ready for the era of intelligent manufacture. The R&D is currently underway for a future-oriented industrial internet platform aiming to make better use of industrial data for higher level of efficiency, digitalization, and automaton in manufacture.

Rail business recorded a 30.9% year-to-year growth in quarterly revenue at $45.5 million, while quarterly contract declined year-to-year by 24.6% at $37.9 million. Few contract on ATP was signed in this quarter and the visibility of CRC bidding remains to be observed. In overseas business, we signed a maintenance contract with Hong Kong MTR with a service duration of three years. In subway, we continued to execute signed contracts, while strengthening our marketing capacity through reviewing and updating strategic partnership and improving local service network coverage. Management team will adhere to the diversity strategy to create revenue stream from more new products and services and to maintain a stable and healthy growth into the future.

In oversea business, we continued to seek opportunities under the Belt and Road Initiative, signing several EPC contracts with domestic companies, including a contract with Shenhua Guohua Co.Ltd to provide DEH for 2X350MW power station in Indonesia. Our effort [indiscernible] (00:09:10) operation management and risk control in mechanical and electrical installation services has worked efficiently, with quarterly revenue recorded at 59.4% year-to-year growth at $29.4 million and a 303.0% year-to-year growth of quarterly contract at $21.2 million. We will continue to address operation, management and risk control issue and to closely follow the economic and political circumstances in South East Asia and Middle East.

With this, I would like to turn the call over to Arden Xia, who will read the financial results analysis on behalf of CFO, Mr. Herriet Qu.

Thank you, Mr. Shao. I would like to share some highlights for the fiscal year 2018 third quarter ended March 31, 2018. Comparing the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, the total revenues for the third quarter increased from $91.3 million to $120.6 million, representing an increase of 32.1%. Broken down by the revenue types, integrated contracts revenue increased by 34% to $104.7 million, product sales revenue increased by 1.7% to $9.9 million, and services revenue increased by 76.2% to $6 million.

The company total revenues can be also presented in segment. Three months ended March 31, industrial automation, $45.7 million; railway transportation, $45.5 million; M&E, $29.4 million; total $120.6 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 66.4% for the third quarter as compared to 30.7% for the same period of prior year.

The non-GAAP gross margin for integrated contracts, product sales and service rendered were 30%, 81.2% and a 73.6% for the third quarter as compared to 24.4%, 65.2%, and 78.8% for the same period of prior year respectively. The gross margin fluctuation was mainly due to the different revenue mix with different margin. The GAAP overall gross margin which includes non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles was 36.4% for the third quarter as compared to 30.7% for the same period of prior year.

The GAAP gross margin for integrated contract product sales and service rendered were 30%, 81.2%, and 73.6% for the third quarter as compared to 24.4%, 65.2%, and 78.8% for the same period of prior year, respectively. Selling expenses was $6.2 million for the third quarter representing an increase of $0.2 million or 4.1% compared to $6 million for the same quarter of prior year.

Presented as percentage of total revenues, selling expenses was 5.1% and 6.5% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, 2017 respectively. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $7.6 million for the third quarter representing a decrease of $1.2 million or 13% compared to $8.8 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease of $2.3 million in bad debt provision.

Presented as a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP G&A expenses 6.3% and a 9.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 2017 respectively. The GAAP G&A expenses which included the non-cash share-based compensation expenses were $7.9 million and $6.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 2017, respectively.

R&D expenses were $8.8 million for the third quarter representing an increase of $2.7 million or 43.7% compared to $6.1 million for the same quarter of the prior year, mainly due to increased R&D activities. Presented as a percentage of total revenues, R&D expenses were 7.3% and 6.7% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 2017 respectively.

The VAT refunds and government subsidies were $3.9 million for the third quarter as compared to $5.5 million for the same period in prior year, representing a $1.6 million or 29.4% decrease, which was primarily due to decrease of the government subsidies for $2.6 million. The income tax expenses and the effective tax rate were $4.6 million and the 17.2% for the third quarter, as compared to $4.4 million and a 22.1% for the comparable prior year period. The effective tax rate fluctuation was mainly due to the different pre-tax income mix with different tax rates as the company's subsidiaries apply to different tax rates.

The non-GAAP net income attributable to HollySys, which excludes the non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which is calculated based on the numbers of shares or options granted under the fair value as of the grant date, amortization of acquired intangible assets, fair value adjustments and acquisition-related considerations and fair value adjustments of bifurcated derivative was $22.1 million or $0.36 per diluted share based on 61.3 million shares outstanding for the third quarter. This represents a 61.1% increase over the $13.7 million or $0.22 per share based on 61.2 million shares outstanding reported in a comparable prior year period.

The net cash used investing activities was $5 million, mainly consisted of $29.9 million time deposits placed with banks, which was partially offset by $26.6 million maturity of deposits.

The net cash used in financing activities was $0.1 million, mainly consisted of $0.5 million prepayment of short-term bank loan which would partially offset by $0.4 million proceeds from short-term bank loans. The total amount of cash and cash equivalents and time deposits with original maturities over three months were $385 million, $365.4 million and $268.8 million as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.

As of March 31, 2018, the company held $238 million in cash and cash equivalent and $147 million in time deposits with original maturity over three months.

At this time, we'd like to open up for the Q&A session. Please note that for Chinese speaking participant, we can also provide Q&A Mandarin and we'll provide translation.

[Foreign Language] (00:19:32-00:19:44)

Operator, please.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Chang from Citigroup. Please ask your question.

[indiscernible] (00:20:17) Alex.

[Foreign Language] (00:20:21)

[Foreign Language] (00:20:24)

[Foreign Language] (00:20:24), Arden. [Foreign Language] (00:20:27-00:22:26).

Thank you, Alex. The first question focused on industrial automation and this quarter the new contract is – compare increased a lot. And can you say something about, for example, like the chemical/petrochemical and the proportion of this part and also the power factor for the process control? And also, I want to know except that the process control, what about the factory automation contribute for the new contract of IA?

And also, the last one is for the upcoming period. How about the industrial automation can maintain such level of the contribution new contract? And then, the second question is for the bidding for the CRC and recently we could see that the bidding pipeline is also not too much, just a few by the [indiscernible] (00:23:37) CRC. How about the delivery of one project? For example, the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong deadline, what about the time schedule for deadline in operation? And also, how about the upcoming like the fourth quarter, the pipeline from the bidding of the China Railway Corporation?

The last question is about the R&D expenses. Right now, it increased fast and what HollySys focused areas within the expenditure? And also, in future about the absolute value will maintain this level or the proportion of the R&D expenses?

[Foreign Language] (00:24:29-00:25:12). The first question answer, actually, yes. The chemical, petrochemical, we are focusing on this area and we do a lot of activity. For example, we import a lot of [ph] experts (00:25:27) within this area to the company. And also, we participate a lot of industry level conference to broaden our power within this area and right now about a proportion for the [indiscernible] (00:25:48), PAs the process control take 90% of IA and around a 10% from the FA of IA. And within the PA, the chemical, petrochemical take around a 40% of the profit-controlled revenue and the power take also like 40% of the process-controlled revenue.

[Foreign Language] (00:26:18-00:27:24).

The railway transportation (sic) [rail transportation] (00:27:28) right now, China Railway Corporation, CRC is under the reform of the corporate system, so a lot of [ph] pipeline (00:27:39) of procurement delayed right now. So that's why we are working – focus under the maintenance service after sales this part at the supplement. And actually like the Shenzhen, Guangzhou to Hong Kong, Hong Kong deadline, we recently signed a contract for the maintenance service. Contract size around HKD 280 million and we will continue to focus this area to support.

And by the way, the CRC procurement is delaying and we could see it going to start bidding for the second half of this calendar year. So that is to say for the next – the coming fiscal year. And we think from the revenue part, it cannot be factored too much because we recognize revenue followed by percent of completion. But from the contract, the upcoming fourth quarter may be still under challenge, but we also will focus on the maintenance, the other things at the supplement.

[Foreign Language] (00:29:04-00:29:28).

About the R&D expenditure, right now, we focus on two areas. One is the high-speed rail, for example, like the [ph] C2 200, 250 kilometer (00:29:41) power segment. We are under the research, development for the new standard multiple trains for the CRC.

And the second part is for the digital intelligent platform. This is, right now start from the Factory automation, but at the end, it will implement to support all that business by our side. For example, no matter PA or FA or even the transportation also could use this platform. For the future, no matter absolute value or the proportion, we're going to maintain – our stable, like the proportion for example between [ph] 6% to 8% (00:30:31) and we will focus on efficiency and productivity. Thank you.

Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:30:41).

[Foreign Language] (00:30:43)

Operator, next one.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Thomas Zhang from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:30:59)

[Foreign Language] (00:31:00)

[Foreign Language] (00:31:04-00:33:26)

The first question is about the gross margin. And actually, right now, gross margin is still very good. But the explanation for this kind of change is by the structure of the business [ph] task (00:33:45), but naturally, from my perspective view, it's not very sharply to performance by the different structure. Can you explain more further about this area? And is it sustainable for this gross margin for the future?

And the second question for the industrial automation, we could see the whole industry from 2017 to now 2018, the industry is later recovering and good. The upcoming will maintain this momentum or [indiscernible] (00:34:27) to do the other business allocated resources to increase the industrial automation to maintain this level?

And the third part question is about [indiscernible] (00:34:45) for the proportion of the process control, about 40% of process control revenue contributed by chemical and petrochemical and the 40% from power.

And the fourth question is about the new product within the railway transportation (sic) [rail transportation] (00:35:10) like [indiscernible] (00:35:11), like the subway signaling, is there any update for this area?

[Foreign Language] (00:35:20-00:36:35). The first question about the gross margin and actually it not just depends on the structure of the business. As everybody knows that industrial automation, roughly between 35% to 40% and the railway transportation (sic) [rail transportation] (00:36:51) between 40% and 50%, M&E just around 10%, so this mix can [indiscernible] (00:36:59) gross margin change. But, also we want to emphasize another thing is that we have a lot of project within one year, for example, thousands of the projects, especially within the IA, so part of the project [indiscernible] (00:37:16) 30% of the IA and the part of the gross margin above 35%. So this can also mix by the different projects.

And also, we advertise some part of the high contribute the gross margin contractor like the nuclear power and also, right now the service contract is increasing very fast and also the service contract roughly above at least at 50% of gross margin. So these factors will account for the changes of the gross margin, but we will maintain the gross margin between 35% to 40% this range.

[Foreign Language] (00:37:57-00:39:32)

Okay. I translate first. The second question for the industrial automation actually from 2017 to the 2018, the market is recovering even not too strong, but we also felt [indiscernible] (00:39:47) our business and to focus on especially on chemical – petrochemical area. And for example, we host a lot of conferences within our factory to introduce hundreds of customer and experts together and to let them know our products, know our strengths within the chemical and new solution to the new chemical and petrochemical. So this works and that's why this part also contributed to IA increase by our revenue.

And the third question about the proportion, let me introduce – the industrial automation 90% of the industrial automation revenue from the process control and within the process control, 40% -- roughly 40% from the chemical and petrochemical. The other 40% from the power, power by the way includes the coal fire, new energy and thermal power.

The fourth question about new product within the rail [indiscernible] (00:41:02) we just have got the regular speed license. And we already got – we are focusing on the [indiscernible] (00:41:10) and right now we already [ph] got our test on line and at the test line (00:41:16) it will start in operation at least one year – I mean, roughly around one year. So we could negotiate part of it after one year. So we can start the license process by the CRC. And the stuff [indiscernible] (00:41:39) signaling right now we are working on it. So just we hope to bring the new information in future.

[Foreign Language] (00:41:53-00:43:52).

Okay. The first question [indiscernible] (00:44:00) for the industrial automation increase, we could hear about you are opening some – a lot of conference focused on the customer and also experts to introduce your product, but I think this is most reflected by from the new contract. However, the industrial automation revenue, I feel worry about the power, especially coal fire and this part is the drive by the history of HollySys.

So right now, can you talk a little bit distinguish about the power and chemical. For example, like right now the revenue, the coal fire still, the main drive or power still the main drive and also, maybe this sector, the power clients, the quality more better than the chemical or the gross margin still have difference. This is the first question.

And the second one for the railway transportation (sic) [rail transportation] (00:45:14), we can see a lot of new maintenance service contract. Can you introduce a little bit about this area? What kind of specific thing you are doing for the maintenance? For example, like ATP automatic train protection, this one needed the maintenance? In my knowledge so far, it's just a replacement at the end of their lifetime. Still need any maintenance during the period before the lifetime?

And the third question for the operating cash flow and this quarter compare decreased, why? The first and second question will be answered by Mr. Shao.

[Foreign Language] (00:46:04-00:51:15). The first question about the revenue compare about the chemical, petrochemical and auto power and also we worry about the coal fire. The answer is, naturally, this area, the differences from the clients have no too much difference, because no matter chemical, petrochemical or the coal fire or power, still have the high quality customer and also have the small project from the small client like – but we will focus on different level, have different team to negotiate with the customer.

And we want to emphasize the coal fire right now from the absolute value is maintained stable, but from the proportion it is declining, because the other area is growing like the thermal, like the new energy. And at thermal, we emphasize on this more capacity project and this part is, no matter from the local heating or local support or productivity, steam support, those kind of things is growing very fast. And the gross margin depends on different project under the same thing, chemical, petrochemical, also have a low margin, high margin. So it's based on the project [indiscernible] (00:52:54).

And to the second question for high speed rail maintenance, we – in this area, we provide a maintenance like the checking, like the support operating, like the training, no matter from the software or hardware. And Hong Kong MTR project, for example, we signed a new service contract, is focused on the – to secure within [indiscernible] (00:53:23) about the smooth operation of our devices and checking and also to training their people to take care of the equipment.

And the ADP also needed maintenance. For example, the whole high-speed is running regular at the daytime. At night, it stops for the checking, for the maintenance to support the second day operating smooth. So that's why the maintenance also divided by the low level and high level from one to four, so this for the maintenance.

And last question for the operating cash flow, this quarter compare a little not strong, but actually from the first to nine months, we could see the operating cash flow still very strong, more than [ph] $17 million (00:54:20). And we think the operating cash flow is positive. If it's positive, it's still good rather than a specific number, but however, by the history of the – our policies, the operating cash flow always positive and roughly around [ph] $40 million, $70 million (00:54:39) and right now [indiscernible] (00:54:42) still very strong and we think that the whole year – fiscal year, we'll maintain [indiscernible] (00:54:46) momentum.

[indiscernible] (00:54:50) because of time restraint, one more last question. Please, operator.

Your next question comes from Rui Yi Xu from Bernstein. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:55:09)

[Foreign Language] (00:55:14).

[Foreign Language] (00:55:15-00:55:52)

[Foreign Language] (00:55:53-00:56:22)

[Foreign Language] (00:56:24-00:56:31)

[Foreign Language] (00:56:33). The first question about the proportion of IA and FA contributed from the net income, but I already make supplement. I said actually we give the proportion [indiscernible] (00:56:50) by the revenue, not the net income. The net income [indiscernible] (00:56:54) FA and PA because the expenditure. We not disclose this data. But from the revenue, just like what we said, the proportion 90% for PA, 10% of IA of revenue supported by the Factory automation. And also, the supplement is about the gross margin and the growth rate by the PA versus Factory automation, FA.

[Foreign Language] (00:57:33-00:58:21). The increase rate by the PA, [ph] FA (00:58:26) and Factory automation may be faster than the PA, because the base is also small and currently still not contribute too much 10% of IA revenue. But the growing speed would be more faster and we are focused in this area and we hope it can support as the key driver of IA in the upcoming years.

And the gross margin not too much difference, because the Factory automation also like the project or like the integrated contract including the product by ourselves and [indiscernible] (00:59:09) and also implementing of the project, engineering. So the gross margins just like the IA average, I mean, [ph] 35 to 40 (00:59:21). Maybe some particular, first, the contractor for the demonstration maybe lower than that, but we still focus on the gross margin within this level.

[Foreign Language] (00:59:32)

[Foreign Language] (00:59:33). Thank you.

Thank you, everyone for joining us on call today. If you haven't got a chance to raise your questions, we're pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We're looking forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.
