Operator
: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Heritage-Crystal Clean Incorporated Fourth


Quarter and Fiscal Year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all callers'


microphones are muted and you will have an opportunity at the end of the presentation to ask questions.


Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up your question. We ask that all callers limit


themselves to one or two questions.


Some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking. Generally, the words aim, anticipate, believe,


could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, project, should, will be, will continue, will likely result, would and


similar
 
expressions
 
identify
 
forward-looking
 
statements.
 
These
 
statements
 
involve
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
risk
 
and


uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking


statements. These risks and uncertainties include a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These


forward-looking statements speak as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the


future.


We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Please refer to our SEC filings including our


annual report on Form 10-K as well as our earnings release posted on our website for a more detailed description


of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the SEC or by


visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.


Also, please note that certain financial measures we may use on this call, such as earnings before interest, taxes,


depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Please see our website for reconciliations of


these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. For more information about our company, please visit our website
