MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello and welcome to today’s Encore Wire Third Quarter Conference Call. As a


reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode, and there will be time for Q&A at the end of the call.


[Operator Instructions]


I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, President. Go ahead please.


Daniel L. Jones, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly earnings conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief


Executive Officer of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer.


Slow down in construction activity in the United States continues to impact our industry adversely


as it has over the last three years and commercial construction has been slowing since beginning


of 2008. Unit volume decreases have affected our industry and created a volatile, pricing


environment. They compress the spread between what we paid for a pound of copper, versus what


we’re able to charge per wire that contained a pound of copper.


In the third quarter of 2009, the spread fell by 24.3%, versus the third quarter of 2008. And it fell by


19.6% for the first nine months of 2009, versus the first nine months of 2008. We attempted to lead


the industry with several price increases during the quarter, but met limited success, as the average


spread remained almost unchanged on a sequential quarter basis.


The fact that we have managed to post break-even results in this difficult environment is due to our


low cost business model and aggressive cost cutting in all facets of our operation. Our staff has


worked diligently to control cost effectively while maintaining the service level to our customers


Encore is known for.


Our reps in the field tell us the volatility of copper over the last year, coupled with declining industry


volumes, has caused many of our distributor customers to lean down their inventory levels. The low


inventory levels in the distribution chain make Encore’s excellent order fill rates valuable to


customers who are gravitating towards just-in-time inventory.


We believe our volume decreases are less than the total industry and we believe that we are able


to get a slight premium for our excellent service level from customers who realize they’re saving


money by buying from us. Despite our desire and efforts to do better, our performance is


impressive in this economy and we thank our employees and associates for their tremendous


efforts. We also thank our shareholders for the continued support. Frank?


Frank J. Bilban, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance


Thank you Daniel. In a minute we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a copy


of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. This release is available on the


Internet or you can call Denise List at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we review financials let me indicate that in these initial comments, and in the question-and-


answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advice you that all such statements

involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today.


I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed discussion


of these risks and uncertainties. Also, reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed


during this conference call to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in


accordance with GAAP including EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information


for investors, are posted on www.encorewire.com.


Now the financial results. Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, were $168.7


million compared to 296.3 million during the third quarter of 2008. Lower prices for building wires


sold in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 accounted for much of the decrease in net sales


dollars, declining 25.1% per copper pound sold versus the same period in 2008.


Unit sales in the third quarter of 2009 decreased 24% versus the third quarter of 2008. Sales prices


fell primarily due to lower copper prices and building wire industry competition.


Net income for the third quarter of 2009 was $300,000 versus $8.1 million in the third quarter of


2008. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.01 in the third quarter of 2009 versus


$0.34 in the third quarter of 2008.


Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 were $472.5 million compared to $900.9


million during the same period in ‘08. Lower prices for building wire sold again in the nine months


ended September 30, 2009 accounted for most of the decrease in net sales dollars, declining


37.4% versus the same period in 2008.


Unit volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased 16.3% versus the same


period in 2008. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $5.5 million versus


$23 million in the same period of 2008. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.24 for


the nine months ended September 30, 2009 versus $0.98 in the same period in 2008.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the third quarter of 2009 were $168.7 million


versus $159.4 million during the second quarter of 2009. Unit volume decreased 9.2% on a


sequential quarter comparison. Net income for the third quarter of 2009 was $300,000 versus


$600,000 in the second quarter of 2009.


Fully diluted net income per common share was $0.01 in the third quarter of 2009 versus $0.03 in


the second quarter of 2009.


As usual the real story behind our earnings fluctuation is the spread between what we paid for a


pound of copper versus what we were able to charge for wire that contained a pound of copper. As


Daniel highlighted earlier our spreads were down year-over-year and virtually flat on a sequential


quarterly comparison.


Informed investors who have followed us for some time and understand the dynamics of this


business have always focused on the spread as the key driver of our earnings and understand that


LIFO adjustments are consistently applied under GAAP. LIFO merely serves to bring the latest cost


of materials into the statements and allows these spreads to be accurately included in our results.


Our low cost structure continues to enable us to produce earnings in these turbulent times. We


continue to maintain our strong balance sheet, the only long-term debt we have as of September


30, 2009 is $100 million in long-term notes due in 2011 with our $150 million revolving line of credit


at a zero balance.
