MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, thank you for joining the Encore Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.


As a reminder, all lines will be on listen only mode and we will conduct a Q & A session at the end


of the call. At this time it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, President and


CEO of Encore Wire.


Daniel Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Edmond. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation third quarter conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive


Officer of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilbin our Chief Financial Officer.


Encore Wire’s just posted record sales and earnings for the nine months ended September 30th,


2006. Our third quarter sales of $373 million set a new quarterly sales record and our net earnings


of $1.51 per share were the second best quarterly earnings in the history of the company. Net sales


for the first nine months of 2006 increased 473.1 million or 92.1% to a record 987 million and our


net earnings of 4.60 per share are also a record. Our trailing twelve months have produced net


sales of $1.23 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $6.10. Margins have been strong for the


last four consecutive quarters driven largely by copper prices which continue to trade near historic


highs, driven by strong global demand. Copper prices have been relatively volatile but continue to


trade near historic highs. A number of industry sources indicate the outlook for commercial


construction is very positive nation wide. As we’ve previously reported we began shipping armored


cable to customers in July. We continue to install machinery in the new armored cable plant to


enable us to manufacture a broad mix of armored cable products and to maintain our historically


high order fill rates.


Our plants ran very efficiently during the quarter enabling us to maintain low production cost. Our


general and administrative costs remain extremely low. We continue to focus on tied cost controls


throughout our operation. We also continue to strive to improve margins while resisting to urge the


urge to gain volume by cutting prices, by focusing on our customer’s attention on our innovative


products, pure order fill rates and long term relationships. We believe there is room for significant


growth of Encore Wire sales and earnings in the future and we’re very proud of our Encore’s


achievements and the hard work our employees and associates put forth to make it happen.


Frank Bilbin, our Chief Financial Officer will now discuss our financial results. Frank.


Frank Bilbin, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you Daniel. In a minute I will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a copy


of Encore’s press release covering non-course financial results. This release is available on the


Internet or you can call Doris Easterland or me at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we begin, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question and answer period


that follows we may make certain statements that might be considered to be forward looking. In


order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to identify each


particular statement as forward looking, we advise you that all such statements involved certain


risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed


today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed


discussion of these risks and uncertainties.

Now the financial results. Net sales for the first nine months of 2006 increased $473.1 million or


92.1% to a record $987 million compared to $513.9 million during the first nine months of 2005.


Higher prices for building wire sold in 2006, driven by higher copper costs, primarily accounted for


the increase in net sales dollars versus 2005. Net income for the first nine months of 2006


increased 643% to a record $109 million versus $14.7 million in the first nine months of 2005. Fully


diluted net earnings per common share were $4.60 in the first nine months of 2006 versus $0.63 in


the first nine months of 2005. Net sales for the third quarter of 2006 increased $165.4 million or


80% to a record $372.9 million compared to $207.5 million during the third quarter of 2005. Net


income for the third quarter of 2006 increased 219% to $35.8 million versus $11.2 million in the


third quarter of 2005. Fully diluted net earnings per common share increased to $1.51 in the third


quarter of ’06 versus $0.48 in the third quarter of 2005.


Due to our strong cash flow in the third quarter, our debt rose only $30 million to $185 million


despite the fact that our working capital requirements increased by $65.8 million and we invested


$3.8 million on capital expenditures. Our shareholders equity increased by $110.7 million in the first


nine months of 2006 to $321.2 million. Our debt balance remains conservative and our interest cost


is low.


We also want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the


conclusion of this session. Anyone wishing to hear the taped replay should call 866-206-0173 and


enter the conference reference number 190695 and the pound sign. I’ll now turn the floor back over


to Daniel Jones our President. Daniel.


Daniel Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. As Frank highlighted, Encore posted record sales and profits during the quarter. We


believe we’re well positioned for future growth. And Edmond will now take questions from our


listeners.
