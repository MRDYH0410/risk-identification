MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 eMagin


Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is [inaudible] and I will be your operator for today.


At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer


session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions].


I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Campbell, CFO of eMagin. Please proceed.


Paul C. Campbell, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you very much. Good morning everyone. Before I begin, I would like to remind you all that


we will be referring to numbers that are part of our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 and


that during today’s call we may make forward-looking statements as they are defined in the Private


Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on the


company’s current expectations, projections, beliefs and estimates, and are subject to a number of


risks and uncertainties.


Such statements include reference projections of future revenues, plans for product development


and production, the company’s ability to ramp up its production at our manufacturing facilities,


future contracts and commercial arrangements, future product benefits, future operations, liquidity


and capital resources, as well as statements containing words like believes, expects, estimate,


plan, anticipate, target, will, intend, seek, could, would and other similar expressions.


Risk factors are included in the company’s Form 10-K report for 2008 on file with the Securities and


Exchange Commission. Except if it’s directly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake


no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new


information, future events, changes in circumstances or any other reason.


I would like now to introduce Andrew Sculley, President and CEO of eMagin Corporation. Andrew?


Andrew G. Sculley, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you and thank you all for attending our Second Quarter Conference Call. I am pleased to


report that eMagin’s business continues to gain momentum. We posted record sales and record


profits in the second quarter of 2009.


Revenues were $5.9 million for the second quarter, the highest quarterly sales in our history. Net


income totaled $1.3 million compared to a loss of $122,000 in the second quarter of last year, also


the highest in our history.


Revenues in the first half of 2009 were up 34%, totaling $11 million compared to $8.3 million in the


first half of last year. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of positive operating income and


fourth consecutive quarter of positive net income. This performance is a direct result of our team’s


efforts to drive the business and our company’s refocus on our core microdisplay manufacturing


business.


For the quarter display sales represent about three quarters of our total revenue. We believe the


clear superiority of OLED microdisplays will become more and more apparent as our customers


deploy eMagin equipped products into the field. For example Qioptiq recently unveiled its new


MIRIR suite of compact thermal weapon and surveillance sites designed for United States law


enforcement and Homeland Security markets.

In addition to strong and steady orders from our core customers we are also beginning to get some


significant orders from OASYS contract that we won in 2008. In addition, our new SXGA display


looks to have very good customer acceptance and future sales potential.


Our manufacturing and our R&D teams continue to deliver improved manufacturing processes that


reduce manufacturing defects and increase yield. The effects of these improvements can be seen


in our increased gross margin and profitability; not only has our team proven that OLED


microdisplays are manufacturable, we’ve also proven that they are profitable.


I’ll turn it back over to Paul to go through the financial results.


Paul C. Campbell, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Andrew. Second quarters revenues of 5.9 million were strong exceeding last quarter by


$700,000. Trailing four quarter revenues totaled 21.5 million and we expect revenue for the third


quarter of 2009 to exceed last year’s third quarter of 5.2 million. Last quarter we reported that we


expected to exceed 2008 full year revenue in 2009 and we are now well ahead of that pace.


As Andrew mentioned, our manufacturing team results continue to improve. Gross margin


improved significantly this quarter totaling 65% compared to 47% second quarter of last year, 48%


in the first quarter of this year. The [inaudible] improvements in the cost controls we have


discussed over the past year continue to drive the higher gross margin. In addition expenses


decreased, royalty expenses decreased this quarter and that is also reflected in the gross margin.


Operating expenses for second quarter 2009 were 2.3 million and did not increase, but remained


even with second quarter 2008. Lower operating expenses due to cost reductions implemented by


management during the past year were offset by higher non-cash stock option expenses. Stock


option expenses totaled 393,000 in second quarter 2009 compared to 252,000 last year.


Operating expenses for the first half of 2009 are down about $600,000 from last year on higher


revenue this year. Operating income for second quarter 2009 totaled 1.5 million compared to


292,000 in second quarter 2008.


eMagin was cash flow or EBITDA positive by 1,773,000 in the second quarter. This was the fifth


consecutive quarter of positive operating income and cash flows and fourth consecutive quarter of


positive net income. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA including the current quarter is $4.6 million.


Net income for the second quarter 2009 was 1.3 million, compared to a loss of 122,000 second


quarter 2008. Earnings per outstanding share were $0.08, earnings per diluted share were $0.05.


Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2009 were $0.07 per share.


We reported last quarter that we retired all of our long-term debt with an equity transaction in


December. One result of that accomplishment is that our debt payments and interest expense


have decreased dramatically in the first half of 2009 and this results in increased net income and


increased production of cash.


We paid down our line of credit by $2.1 million to just $232,000 outstanding as of June 30, 2009


and we maintained a $2.8 million cash balance at the end of the second quarter. We also funded


about $480,000 in capital improvements so far in 2009.


With that, I’ll turn it back over to Andrew.
