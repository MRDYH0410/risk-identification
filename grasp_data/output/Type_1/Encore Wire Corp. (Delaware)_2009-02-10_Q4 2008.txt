MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Encore Wire Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a


reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&A session at the end of the


call. [Operator Instructions].


At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, the President of Encore Wire to begin.


Please go ahead.


Daniel L. Jones, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you, Eric. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly earnings conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and CEO of


Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our CFO.


We’re pleased to announce significantly increased earnings in the midst of the tough competitive


environment we’re experiencing in our industry and the slump in the overall US economy. The


slowdown in construction activity in the United States continues to adversely impact unit volume in


our industry, as it has over the last two plus years. However, we were able to increase our margins


significantly despite declining unit volumes and copper prices. We’re pleased that our industry has


exhibited some measure of pricing discipline in response to these two trends.


Copper prices were volatile during the second half of 2008 starting at a COMEX close price of


$3.92 per pound on July 1 and closing at $1.39 per pound on December 31. Volatility of that


magnitude and the uncertainty it generates tends to disrupt our customers’ normal buying patterns


and has historically contributed to competitive pricing pressure. We believe we sacrificed unit


volume in 2008, acting as an industry leader by exerting pricing discipline, enabling us to grow


profits in a down market. Our reps in the field also tell us the volatility of copper over the last year,


coupled with declining industry volumes, has caused many of our distributor customers to lean


down their inventory levels. These low inventory levels in the distribution center or in the


distribution chain makes Encore’s excellent order fill rates more valuable to customers. We believe


our volume decreases are less than the total industry and we believe that we are able to get a slight


premium for our excellent service level from customers who realize the value of our approach.


Making $1.70 per share in this economy is an impressive accomplishment and we thank our


employees and associates for their tremendous efforts. Encore Wire is ranked as the #5 Best


Performing Stock for 2008 in the DSW area by the Dallas Morning News with a 19.1% gain for the


year. We thank our shareholders for their continued support.


Now, Frank will cover the numbers. Frank?


Frank J. Bilban, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Vice President of Finance,


Secretary and Treasurer

Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question and


answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to

identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statement involve


certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more


detailed discussion of those risks and uncertainties.


Also, for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this conference call to the


most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including


EBITDA which we believe to be useful supplemental information for investors, are posted on


www.encorewire.com under latest press releases.


Now, for the financial results. Net sales for the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31,


2008 were $180.2 million compared to $281.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income


for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $16.7 million versus a loss of $1.1 million in 2007. Fully diluted


net earnings per common share were $0.72 in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus a loss of $0.05 in


the fourth quarter of 2007. Gross margins increased 363% to 22.2% versus 4.8% in 2007. The


63.9% decline in dollar sales from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008 was due


to the average selling price declining 21% coupled with a 19% decline in unit sales. It should be


noted for comparison purposes that the fourth quarter of 2007 was a strong quarter in terms of unit


sales. Average selling prices fell due to declining copper prices. The average cost of copper


purchased fell 43% in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus the fourth quarter of 2007.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $180.2 million


versus $296.3 million during the third quarter of 2008. Excuse me, that was during the third quarter


of 2007. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 106% to 16.7 million versus 8.1


million in the third quarter of 2008. Fully diluted net income per common share was $0.72 in the


fourth quarter of 2008 versus $0.34 in the third quarter of 2008.


Net sales for the year ending December 31, 2008 were 1.08 billion or 1,081 million compared to


1,185 million during 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $39.8 million


versus $30.8 million in 2007. Fully diluted net earnings per common share increased 31% to $1.70


for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus $1.30 in 2007.


Our unit volume shipped in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 19% versus the fourth quarter of


‘07. Our year-to-date unit volume was down 12%. The average selling price of wire containing a


pound of copper decreased by 20.9% while the average cost of a pound of copper purchased


decreased 42.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus the fourth quarter of 2007. This spread


increased by 72.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 and


increased by 33.4% on a sequential quarter comparison and 19.3% on a total year-over-year basis.


These increased spreads drove our gross margin increase.


Informed investors who have followed us for some time and understand the dynamics of our


business have always focused on the spread as the key driver of our earnings and also understand


that LIFO adjustments are consistently applied under GAAP. LIFO accounting merely serves to


bring the latest cost of materials into the statements and allows the spreads we’ve just discussed to


be accurately included in our results.


Our balance sheet remains strong. The only long-term debt we have as of December 31, 2008 is


$100 million in long-term notes due in 2011, with our $150 million revolving line of credit paid down


to zero. In addition, our $217.7 million cash balance, as of December 31, 2008, exceeds our long-


term debt by over two times. We also declared our ninth consecutive quarterly cash dividend


during the fourth quarter of 2008.


We want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion


of this session. If you wish to hear the tape replay, call (866) 439-4729 and enter the conference
