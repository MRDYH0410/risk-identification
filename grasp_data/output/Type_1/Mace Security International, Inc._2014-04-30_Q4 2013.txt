Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Harry. And I'll be your operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and year-end December 31, 2013, and first quarter ended March 31, 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I like to turn the call over to CEO, Mr. John McCann. Mr. McCann, you may begin.

Such factors could materially adversely affect Mace's financial performance.

It could cause Mace's results for the future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed during this call. I will now review our fourth quarter and year-end 2013 financial results and first quarter 2014 financial results. After I finished, I'll turn the call back over to John, [indiscernible] (00:02:23) over to John. Who will then respond to the questions that will be – that were e-mailed in. And lastly, we'll open the lines for questions.

All right. For the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2013, consolidated fourth quarter net revenues were $2.99 million compared to $2.146 million for the fourth quarter of last year, a decrease of $47,000 or 2.2%. This decrease by product category was mainly attributed to a $40,000 decrease in [indiscernible] (00:02:58) Gard products, a $23,000 decrease in non-aerosol products, and was offset by a 28,000 increase in aerosol and pepper spray net revenues.

Net revenues from surveillance products were down $8,000. Comparative net revenue totals for the quarter are as follows. Aerosol, our defense sprays were $1.411 million compared to $1.383 million in Q4 2012. An increase of $28,000 or 2%. Non-aerosol, which includes [indiscernible] (00:03:33) and other non-spray products, were $128,000, down $23,000 or 15% compared to fourth quarter 2012. Net revenues of $151,000.

Other, which I included [indiscernible] (00:03:48) private label and law enforcement products, totaled $198,000, compared to $242,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012, a decrease of $44,000 or 18%. The decrease in other is mainly attributed to a $40,000 decrease in sales of [indiscernible] (00:04:08) products, which are products geared towards embassies and correctional facilities.

And we attribute this decline to timing. Now, a few of our gross profit. Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter 2013 totaled $714,000, with a 34% gross margin compared to $802,000 and 37.4% gross margin for 2012, a decrease of $88,000 or 11% and a decrease of 3.4 points in margins. This decrease can be attributed to $47,000 decrease in revenues for the quarter and $84,000 and onetime charges to cost of revenues related to the overlap of manufacturing and distribution labor during the transition from Bennington, Vermont to Cleveland, Ohio, and a $72,000 write-off of some surveillance inventory.

SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013 were $1.902 million compared to $1.799 million in 2012, an increase of $123,000. Both quarters had significant notable onetime expenditures. Fourth quarter notable charges for 2013 were approximately $616,000, including severance, relocation costs for moving manufacturing to Ohio and asset write-offs.

Fourth quarter notable expenditures for 2012 were approximately $478,000, including severance and relocation costs for moving the corporate headquarters from Horsham, Pennsylvania to Cleveland, Ohio, and a $200,000 favorable adjustment related to accounts receivable. Discontinued operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013 had income of $1.9 million, compared to $256,000 loss for last year. The $1.924 million in net income is mainly attributed to the $2.2 million gain on the sale of the Mace Central Station.

As a result, net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 was $613,000 compared – compared to a net loss of $1.506 million. An increase in net income of $2.119 million. Now, as over the 12 months ending December 31, 2013. Revenues for the 12 months ending December 31, 2013 were $8.18 million compared to $8.690 million from last year, a decrease of $672,000 or 7.7%. This decline was mainly attributed to a $663,000 or 31% decrease in revenues from our electronic surveillance products.

Electronic surveillance revenues totaled $1.462 million compared to prior year revenues of $2.125 million. Breaking this down further, aerosol defense grades were $5.364 million, compared to $5.181 million last year, up $183,000 or 3.5%. Non-aerosol which includes [indiscernible] (00:07:28) and other non-spray products, were $587,000 compared to $652,000, down approximately $65,000 or 10%.

Other, which I included [indiscernible] (00:07:40) once again, private label and law enforcement products totaled $605,000, compared to $750,000 last year, a decrease of $147,000, or approximately 19%. And this is mainly attributed to a decline of $100,000 in some private label sales. Gross profit, consolidated gross profits for the year ending December 31, 2013 and 2012. Totaled $3.087 million and $3.482 million respectively, a decrease of $395,000 or 11.3%.

Consolidated gross margins were 38.5%, compared to 40.1% in 2012. The $395,000 decline in gross profit was mainly attributed to $230,000 in lost profits and a $663,000 decline in surveillance product sales and $400,000 in overhead variances, mainly attributed to severance and overlap of manufacturing and distribution labor.

Overall, after adjusting for move-related costs, gross margins were slightly better than prior year margins. Gross profit on personal defense and aerosol products were $2.532 million and $2.513 million for 2013 and 2012, respectfully of $19,000, with 43% margins for both 2013 and 2012. Consolidated SG&A expenses for the year ending December 31, 2013 were $6.336 million compared to $6.127 million in the prior year, an increase of $209,000 or 3.4%.

Both years had significant onetime notable expenditures. In 2013, onetime notable SG&A expenditures totaled approximately $1.2 million, compared to $597,000 in 2012. The following points I'll communicate material expenditures and increases compared to last year. One-time 2013 expenditures for advertising trade show, public relations and retail channel consulting totaled $287,000, an increase of approximately $196,000 compared to 2012.

Noncash expense for stock options totaled $199,000, an increase of $163,000 compared to 2012. Onetime severance and move related expenditures in 2013 totaled $393,000 for relocating manufacturing from Vermont to Ohio and the revamping of the internal sales force, compared with $698,000 in severance and moving cost in 2012, associated with the relocation of the corporate offices to Cleveland and termination of corporate staff in Horsham office.

2013 also included a $286,000 write-off, our correction of assets. Offsetting 2012, SG&A expenses were $100,000 gain on the sale of an asset and $198,000 favorable adjustment related to receivable. As a result of the above, net loss from continuing operations for the year-ended December 31, 2013 was $3.581 million compared to a net loss of $3.170 million last year. An increased loss of $411,000 or 13%.

Net loss for the year was $2.021 million in 2013, compared to a loss of $4.023 million in 2012. A $2.002 million improvement or 50% decrease in net loss compared to 2012. The improvement in net loss is mainly attributed to gain on sales of Mace Central Station. Consolidated EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2013 after adjusting for one-time notable expenditures of $1.365 million was a negative $1.892 million compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $2.066 million last year, an improvement of $174,000 or approximately 8%.

At this time, I'll make a few comments on our balance sheet at December 31, 2013, and some cash flow items. The company's net book value was $11.9 million at December 31, 2013. Mace had $14.8 million in total assets, including $7.6 million of cash and short-term investments. We had positive working capital of approximately $10.8 million and current ratio of 8 million compared to $8.5 million at December 31, and a current ratio of 5.6.

Total debt at December 31, 2013 remained at approximately $1.1 million, consisting of our debenture note with [indiscernible] (00:12:39) with the maturity date of March 30, 2016. From a cash flow perspective, for the 12 months ending December 31, 2013, we used approximately $3.6 million of cash and operating activities.

All right. Now focusing on the first quarter ending March 31, 2014. Consolidated net revenues for the first quarter, ending March 31, 2014 were $1.682 million compared to $2.119 million for the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of $510,000 or 23.3%. The overall decrease can be attributed to weather related sluggishness at retail and timing of some pipeline sales quarter-to-quarter.

The decrease can be summarized by the following product category breakdown. Comparative net revenue totals for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 are as follows. Aerosol or defense sprays were $1.103 million compared to $1.507 million in Q1 2013. A decrease of $404,000 or 26.8%. Non-aerosol again, which includes our [indiscernible] (00:13:54) and non-spray products, were $118,000, down $99,000 or 45% compared to first quarter 2013 net revenues of $217,000.

Surveillance net revenues for the quarter ended March 31 was $335,000, compared to $372,000 in Q1 2013. A decrease of $37,000 or 10%. Other combining [indiscernible] (00:14:21) private label and law enforcement products totaled $126,000 compared to $96,000 in first quarter 2013, an increase of $30,000 or 31%.

Our gross profit. Consolidated gross profit for the first quarter ended March 31 totaled $563,000 or a 34% gross margin, compared to $981,000 and 44.8% gross margin for 2013, a decrease of $418,000 or 43%. This decrease in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the $510,000 decrease in net revenues for the quarter. Higher labor cost in January and February attributed to the move, which was significantly reduced in March.

Classification of cost as overhead in 2014 that recorded in G&A in 2013 and timing of expenses. To recap, about $40,000 is attributed to reclassification of expenses from G&A to overhead. Our cost of goods sold. $25,000 can be attributed to higher labor costs in January and February, which have been corrected and lowered in March and in $30,000 unfavorable overhead variances attributed to lower January and February production. And it was about $30,000 is timing of expenditures year-on-year for the quarter.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 were $1.405 million compared to $1.460 million in 2013, a decrease of $55,000 or 3.8%. First quarter of 2014 included increased advertising and expenditures of $96,000 compared to 2013, offset by lower legal audit and professional fees, reflecting a shift in our expenditures to drive sales.

Other income of $104,000 for the quarter ended March 31 was related to gain on sale of investments. As a result, net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 was $794,000, compared to a net loss of 649,000, an increase loss of $145,000 or 22.3%. Now for some balance sheet comments. For the quarter ending March 31, 2014, the company's net book value was $11.1 million at March 31, compared to $11.9 million at December 31, 2013.

We had $13.8 million in total assets, including $7.2 million in cash and short-term investments. And this compares to $14.8 million in total assets, including $7.6 million of cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2013. We had positive working capital of $10.2 million and a current ratio of 8.7. Total debt at March 31, 2014 remained at approximately $1.1 million.

Okay. So let's recap the quarter, fourth quarter 2014 and the year ended in the first quarter of 2014. At this time, do you want to do the questions [indiscernible] (00:17:51)?

Yes.

All right. At this time, we're going to go to some questions that were submitted. And then after that, I'll turn the call back over to John.

Right. And so just one quick note is. We went through, if you go to the website, you'll see a lot of explanations for some of the different issues that we've experienced. And then as we go through the questions, I think we'll bring to light some more questions that you might have at the end of this. And we will take a brief section of live question from the group. So what we'll do now is Carl and I will just read the questions that were submitted and then give our answers too.

All right. The first question I'll address comes from Lawndale Capital Management. With the gain on the sale of the Central Station, about the Q1 loss, approximately what is the level of Mace's NOLs past carry forward balances. Our NOLs are computed at a year end not quarterly basis? So my count is for the year of the year end amount. At the end of the year, $464.5 thousand in NOL expired and $11,500 were added in 2013. Total NOLs at 12/31/2013 were $54.255 million with $1.089 million scheduled to expire 12/31/2018.

So that's the next time [indiscernible] (00:19:23) our head analog expiring. So, additionally, from Lawndale Capital, your press release says that it's time to consider a variety of strategic alternative. Would you please elaborate on this comment? And we are looking at a variety of options other than to say that we do not want to elaborate at this time, but we will continue to inform shareholders at the proper time.

The next question, and we're going to go through all those questions from Lawndale Capital Management, first. Noted already that Nasdaq OTC [indiscernible] (00:19:57) crossbones and stop sign warnings have been replaced with the yield sign with this week issuance of Mace's audited financial statements. When and how do you get the yield signs warning also remove the more need to take the necessary measures to achieve that improving listing standards.

Okay. The stop sign was removed due to the filing of our annual report and first quarter earnings. I anticipate that the US will be removed today or in the very near future as I filed all the needed disclosure information to become current and have the yield sign removed. Most recent communication was from the LTC representative earlier today, and she said with the disclosure that we filed yesterday, it would take an additional 24 hours.

So my expectation is before market opens tomorrow that the yield time will be gone. And in addition [indiscernible] (00:20:47) anticipate having the yield sign in the future as we implemented the closing schedule, which will allow for the timely filing, which we have yield some key requirements.

Next question. When does the restriction on insider stock purchases that has existed for several months go away? According to policy restricted persons, which include members of the board of directors and executive officers, are able to trade for 45 days, commencing three days after a quarterly release, assuming they are not in possession of material nonpublic information regarding the company.

Next question, will the company timely disclose the details of any insider stock transactions? The company has been in a now reporting status since July of 2012 and has no SEC requirement or ability for that matter to disclose any insider stock transactions.

So here comes some May Q4 2013 questions again from Lawndale Capital. To help us better understand how close we feel, you have come for operating breakeven results. Can you please provide a summary description and breakdown of the Q4 charges that you are calling non-recurring and SG&A and separately in COGS [indiscernible] (00:22:08) in the income statement, I believe these were addressed in my script. But to clarify, Q4, non-recurring are notable expenses totaled $701,000, $247,000 related to severance and move related expenses, of which $84,000 is in cost of goods sold.

The following are an SG&A, $60,000 of non-recurring professional expenses or $108,000 in noncash asset and expense and $286,000 related to the write-off of an asset. John, a few more questions from Lawndale, Mace, Q1 2014 questions.

Right. So my question from Lawndale was, with the year-to-year revenue decline a function of lost customers and you feel Mace have lost market share, and if not, why do you feel this way? So in the first quarter we can confidently say we lost no customers, we lost no exclusives other than the fact that we had several customers or clients that merged together, especially in the office channel to the larger players in the office channel merged together with them.

They announced that they were going to close up to 250 stores, which will have an effect on our business with those customers. Secondly, we had a couple of customers from a year ago that had pipeline sales. So it was our first time doing business with them that we didn't get that same mode, if you would, and in the quarter. And then the third thing I can say is that the weather conditions they sent us talking to many of our retail partners, they feel in a 13-week period of the quarter, they lost at least 10 days of business due to the weather closings or in climate weather that didn't allow people to shop in their stores.

One retailer commenting at some point that more people working in the stores than shopping in the stores. And to reiterate Mace's [indiscernible] (00:24:07) side, so we need foot traffic in order to drive some of the impulses that we rely on. Same question again. Here was what was the year-to-year trend by month during the Q1? Was March not as weak as February? And yes, March was much stronger than February. And we saw a positive trend as the period went on.

And then a follow up to that is, given this is the last day of the month, can you share how April year-to-year has shaped up in general? Have retailers cleared inventory and returned to normal and refined levels? April will be much stronger than March and stronger than a year ago prior, we're seeing a slight pickup, not as much as we'd like to. There's still some reluctancy to load in inventories, especially I don't want to talk about weather again, but the Northeast and the southeast is getting hit a little bit with weather and we're still feeling the consolidation of some of our customers that are out there.

I can say that we're pretty pleased with so far, April and with everything that we have to ship. It will be much tighter than a year ago. Have you seen Mace products, I have seen Mace product at walmart.com. What products you personally sell through in a Walmart stores where you're up with the prospects expanding base sales in the Walmart relationship.

So we are on online with walmart.com. We are in the process of expanding our online assortment as the same time, we're working on a store relationship that we think will be very fruitful and viable in the future. Regarding school system sales, is there a predominance of geography and grade level, i.e. elementary, junior, middle school and high school where your school system sales have been occurring or a broad mix already?

So basically it's a broad mix, we've attended several trade shows in the school arena that we have in the past. One was in Columbus, Ohio, one was in New Orleans, Louisiana. We had very good success. We started the groundwork in order to initiate the process of Mace being a solution. Then with regard to where we sell products, it is mostly at the high school level. There's a little bit of the junior high school level and it's been a variety of states from Ohio, Texas, California and New York.

So overall, there's no – it's not just one region where we've had success across the country, and it's been a variety of products, whether it's surveillance equipment or pepper gun quite honestly, is what we have done in Texas and then with the variety of products that we were able to implement in Ohio.

All right. So the next question. With several months of solely operating out of the new Cleveland manufacturing facility. You discussed the unit and overall cost savings you have experienced during Q1 and what additional savings you expect to experience and when should we expect to see these results?

Our response is in Q1, from a production standpoint, we realized manufacturing efficiencies by taking advantage of the warehouse space and increasing our production lot sizes, which minimized downtime, which allowed us to implement and adjust new safety stock levels to minimize out-of-stock situations.

Logistically, we are better able to serve our customers with the ability to have multiple next day delivery pickups, which is hard to come by in Vermont. We are working with our small package carriers to review the current freight costs. We are also in early phases of working with the national third party [indiscernible] (00:27:42) over to take advantage of lower LTL costs.

In January and February and we had higher labor costs in manufacturing as we continue to train and work with the new labor force. In March, we reduced the manufacturing labor force by 30% and believe the same quarter will reflect these additional savings, which we will quantify at that time. Then the next question, your press release didn't make mention of any. So perhaps Mace's restructuring is behind us. To help us better understand how close we feel you have come toward. I'm sorry. Have come to our operating breakeven results.

Can you please provide a summary description and breakdown of the Q1 charge that you are calling non-recurring in SG&A and separately in cost of goods sold in the income statement, [indiscernible] (00:28:35) what I will call restructuring costs such as severance and relocation cost in Q1 of 2014 that weren't accrued for in 2013.

We did incur higher Q1 costs in certain areas, which I will now refer to as non-recurring. Q1 had higher advertising costs relative to the total annual budget and prior year advertising. We had higher manufacturing labor costs in January and February and we had some timing charges related to the severe weather and maintenance.

The next couple questions are from private investor. What sales [indiscernible] (00:29:12) do you estimate is necessary to generate sufficient gross profit to become positive cash flow generating? Basically, on the current cost structure, we're looking at anywhere from $10.5 million to $11.5 million in annualized sales to generate positive cash flow.

Obviously, everything is based on net relationship. When is the realistic target date you are telling the board or the board is holding you to generate this breakeven sales rate? And our goal, as I said before, as soon as possible.

Okay. So then final question from Lawndale is what is Q1 other income from that's a realized gain on the sale of a short-term investment? Now we have one question from Cavender Capital. Are there any non-recurring one-time expenses included in [indiscernible] (00:30:04) in the Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 financial results. Thanks for the question. This was asked and answered just previously, right.

I think also from Cavalier Capital was meant by the phrase concerning a variety of strategic alternatives. And I think that we answered that question under Lawndale. I think it was the second or third question that Lawndale had asked to. Then this is and I apologize. All these – all the prior questions were Lawndale and then Cavender. Now these are private investors. During the past conference calls, management state and implied that one of the added benefits in selling Mace Central Station business was the chance to increase selling other Mace products to security partners line of dealers.

What's the status of this initiative? Kind of as a reminder, through the acquisition, we're able to gain access to 1,700 dealers from our 450 original base, three central stations. They're strategically located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, San Antonio and in Anaheim, California. We have begun the process of jointly presenting to both dealers and to customers a full array of products. So, for example, we have a lot of dealers now buying mace pepper spray as we leave behind for their clients or potential clients.

We attended a franchise show together to give a comprehensive and end solution just this was just last week in Las Vegas to say whether it's monitored or unmonitored, you can use Mace products. And thirdly, we have a major show that we will have exclusive opportunity to present to the majority of the 1,700 dealers and put together program. So we're slowly beginning the process and we've had some success, whether it be surveillance products or pepper spray products that we've been selling to the security partners dealers.

Then can you give more color to the decrease in sales revenue from 2013 versus 2012 and Q1 2014 to 2013? This is in the presentation, but really in 2013 the decrease in sales was almost 100% attributed to our surveillance product where we moved out of a lot of products. We're now still moving through some of the older products, but into our new products. I can tell you that in April of this year we're going to have our best surveillance month. Since I've come on board.

We now have repeat customers. We have some small franchises and chains that are now using our products, and we have some dealers that have gotten stepped up to the table. The 2014, when you look at the numbers, we had a great tactical, we had some other upticks. So we were flat in some different areas versus pipeline sales a year ago. But when you look at consumer and sporting goods, that was the biggest disappointment in the quarter

. And I think it's in line with what we see on some of the government statistics that have come out. And when I've talked to peer groups, they've experienced the same thing. Whether consolidation of the stores are the major two reasons.

Another question came in along the same lines [indiscernible] (00:33:18) is this a result of Mace losing market share? We haven't lost any market share according to the studies that we have and we've run. We saw 52% of market share on a pepper spray side. The surveillance side is very, very fragmented. Nobody really has more than a couple of points, but we've held our own, if not grown in that segmentation of it. So it is really a timing issue, or weather-related issue. And unfortunate that the quarter was as it was. Then, when can you expect the cash flow breakeven quarter.

And as I said earlier, this was [indiscernible] (00:33:56) as soon as possible is our goal. And then what dollar volume of sales do you think we'll create that breakeven cash flow number and have you put out it on a quarterly basis, we would be looking at net revenues anywhere from $2.5 million to $2.8 million based on the current cost structure. And again, that flows into a little bit of mix. It depends on the product sales.

Our next question from the private investor. Please give the status update on the quantitative and qualitative improvements in the manufacturing Mace pepper spray as a result of your move to new facilities in Ohio and I addressed that question in the previous question.

Right. So in the past year you've announced initiatives with Nasdaq, NASCAR, these great press releases. But I wonder if anything realistic comes from these partnerships in their future. I guess my question, as you look into crystal ball, what benefits do you see for Mace's, a result of these partnerships. Taking the NASCAR? It was a onetime event. We have the added benefit of now they have our material and they continue to show it to different races. It was a brand new race team, Circle K Sport.

They offered us this opportunity and directly off of that meeting part automotive part store called us and said, hey, we'd like to meet. And so now we're in the process of meeting with them and working on a program, which is great. The second part on Nasdaq, we've had several meetings and basically our staff is working with their staff and they're giving us free engineering time based on a program through Nasdaq and the local government here in Ohio.

And our goal with that is to take our existing products and see how we can make some tweaks or improvements. For example, on our spray, we're looking at our existing technologies to say, can we – can we continue to do what we're doing and have our products spray a little bit further than it is today? And we've seen some positive activity in that area of things that they would say slight tweaks that could help us achieve that goal.

And then lastly, does Mace have any financial obligations regarding these partnerships? And no, we don't at this point, but that is truly a partnership where they get the credit for anything they help us with. The NASCAR was a onetime event. And as Carl indicated in the financials, we're a little heavy in our advertising side in the year we're staying within our budget range for the entire year on our advertising, but trying to take advantage of what in the media world they call remnant or opportunity. By that, basically if you went to NASCAR and wanted a car sponsorship it would be north of $250,000, up to a million.

Ours was nowhere near those numbers. So that's a great opportunity for us to take advantage of a onetime event. One other item that we took advantage of in that same quarter was our relationship with IMG College, which then we were the one of the sponsors for the basketball tournament for the [indiscernible] (00:37:05) conference. And that was – that was great for us because now there's a couple of bookstores, very small volume [indiscernible] (00:37:12), but there's a couple of bookstores, college bookstores and we're able to gain distribution and because of that partnership.

So those are all the written questions we have and we'll turn it back over to Aaron now for some questions from the audience.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Thurman Willis, private investor. Your line is now open.

Thank you, John and Richard. That was an excellent report. I applaud you for changing the format of the investor call. I think the past calls questions have been way too detailed for most investors, and I think that some flower shareholders, including myself, have shared some calls that probably [indiscernible] (00:38:18) have been held on a private call. I want to apologize for that for myself. And I just want to look at the facts today and say I know that you said a lot of this, but I want to tell you why I feel as an investor, you're so much undervalued.

And I feel that others ought to take a look at this company. And I want to applaud you, John, for what you've done in two years since coming to this company. And, Richard, for the many changes you've made as Chairman over the last 3.5 years. And I think, you know, the investors could go really to your press release and, primarily look at the one main paragraph, but let's just focus on what has been done.

And we know that our stock price has gone down. We know that no one's happy about that. But I have full faith and confidence in the Board of Directors and in management to know that the right thing will be done to enhance shareholder value, have never questioned that. And I do believe that with a small company that basically has no debt and the reverse stock split was an excellent thing to do. Richard and I applaud you for it. We have $0.12 in cash. We have $0.18 in book value.

You eliminated all the car washes, something that prior management did not do in many, many months you have done it and I applaud you. You moved your corporate headquarters, you closed numerous offices and you consolidated in a great way. And I applaud you for that and the expense reduction that will recur over a number of years.

I truly applaud and thank you, as I requested from your attorney, that you get the cross sign removed from your financials, which will now allow many investors to buy where they will not. And so I applaud you for that with getting the yield signal also moved a major item that no one ever thought could be done was getting the EPA to release their ban on Mace. And John, you were responsible for getting that done and that was tremendous.

Also, you sold and got an outstanding price for the Central Station, you know, in California. And as you said, we feel it is an appropriate time to consider a variety of strategic alternatives. And many management teams would not look at that. But I applaud the fact that you are doing that now. I don't want to sound like a cheerleader, of which sometimes I've been accused of, but I don't want to sound like a disgruntled shareholder or I don't want to be a person that asks so many detail questions that other shareholders lose interest on the call and hang up, especially when they last an hour and a half.

And I think we have been guilty on both sides of that. Being a large shareholder, myself and numerous others, I do think and I would make one recommendation and then just ask one question and again say that I have full faith. I have, I am not disgruntled and I'm not a cheerleader. I just simply stated the facts of all that's been done. And this stock now trades lower than it did. We have had debt and that car washes that EPA and all the many, many problems that had to be solved.

So if you look at the NOLs, which were $1 and I think the Mace brand names probably worth $0.50 and the cash we have, you know, maybe at a $1.62, you know, for valuation on this company, assuming of course, we got full value on those NOLs, which I know they will expire in August. And that, of course, will be material because there are many companies that are able to use that.

So I have asked you in the past to consider TASER model systems. Napco and others for consolidation, because I believe the one thing that you need and this is my question, the one thing that you need is a broader sales channel. And I think if we example had TASER's sale channel and we were affiliated with them in some way, that our stock and I think our revenues would triple overnight.

So again, thank you and I will be a buyer of the stock, have interested people who will be a buyer in the stock because I have faith and as I said, management and the board. So I will know the shareholders to know exactly where I'm coming from because I've been involved with the company about 10 years and these are the brightest days even though, yes, we would love to see a $1 stock price and still $0.36. But Richard, could you or John respond to the fact not I know you can't speak specifically about strategic alternatives both ways, that we are looking to broaden on our penetration and relative to partnerships with other companies. And I'm sorry I was long winded, but I want to get that said and I thank you and I will have no other questions with no other comments.

Well, Thurman, thanks. And regard to that, I think it's prudent at this time just to say, what we have said earlier, we're looking at a variety of options and we're open minded in our approach, both on all side of the equation.

Okay. Well, I think Aaron, that's all the questions that I see in the queue. So I want to thank everybody for participating and I think, Aaron, if you want to – if there's any other questions, we can take them. Other than that, I think I want to just thank everybody for participating in the call.

We have no questions.

Okay. Well, super. Well thanks, everybody, for participating. And we're hoping for better results as we move forward.

Thanks, Aaron.

You're welcome. And this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.
