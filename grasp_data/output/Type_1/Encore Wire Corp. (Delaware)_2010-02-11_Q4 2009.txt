MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Encore Wire, Fourth Quarter Conference Call. As a


remainder, all lines will be on listen-only mode, and there will be a Q&A session at the end of the


call. [Operator instructions]


At this time, I would like to welcome and turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, President of Encore


Wire. Go ahead please.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Operating Officer


Thank you, Amanda (:20). Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive Officer


of Encore Wire.


With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer and we have several others in the


room as well. Our Unit volume decreases caused by the slowdown in construction had created a


volatile pricing environment in our industry that compressed the spread between what we paid for a


pound of copper versus what we were able to charge for wire that contained a pound of copper.


In the fourth quarter of 2009, the spread fell by 48.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2008 and it fell


by 27.1% for the full year of 2009 versus 2008. We attempted to lead the industry with several price


increases during the quarter, but met strong competitive price cutting, as the average spread fell


8.8% on a sequential quarter basis.


We managed to earn $3.6 million this past year in the difficult environment due to our low cost


business model and aggressive cost cutting in all facets of our operation. Our staff has worked


diligently to control cost effectively while maintaining the service level to our customers Encore is


known for.


Our reps in the field tell us that the volatility of copper over the last year coupled with declining


industry volumes has caused many of our distributor customers to maintain very lean inventory


levels. Low inventory levels in the distribution chain make Encore’s excellent order fill rates


valuable to customers who are relying on a just in time inventory. We believe our volume decreases


are less than total industry and we believe that we are able to get a slight premium for our excellent


service level from customers who realize value.


We thank our employees and associates for the tremendous efforts. We also like to thank our


shareholders for their continued support.


Now I’ll turn it over to Frank to go with financials.


Frank J. Bilban, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a


copies of – a copy of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. This release is


available on the internet or you can call Denise Liss at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we review financials, let me indicate that in these initial comments and in the question-and-


answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements

involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more


detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this conference call to the


most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including


EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information for investors, are posted on


www.encorewire.com.


Now the financials. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, were $177.1 million


compared to 180.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. Unit sales in the fourth quarter ended


December 31, 2009, decreased 13.1% versus the fourth quarter of ‘08, offset by higher prices for


building wire sold in the quarter.


The average price of building wire sold increased 13.2% per copper pound sold in the fourth


quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales prices rose primarily due to higher copper


prices; however, the intense building wire industry competition did not allow wire prices to rise as


much as copper prices. Copper prices rose 57.1% in the same period comparison.


Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was a loss of $1.9 million versus positive income of $16.7


million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were a loss of


$0.08 in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus earnings of $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.


Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were $649.6 million compared to $1.081 billion


during the year ended December 31, 2008. Lower prices for building wire sold in the year ended


December 31, 2009, accounted for the bulk of the decrease in net sales dollars, declining 28.8%


versus 2008. Unit volume in the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased 15.6% versus 2008.


Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $3.6 million versus $39.8 million in 2008.


Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.16 for the year ended December 31, 2009,


versus $1.70 in 2008.


On a sequential quarter comparison net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $177.1 million


versus $168.7 million during the third quarter of 2009. Unit volume decreased 3.1% on a sequential


quarter comparison, while the average selling price of wire increased 8.5%. Net income for the


fourth quarter of 2009 was a loss of 1.9 million versus a positive $300,000 in the third quarter of


2009. Fully diluted net income per common share was a loss of $0.08 in the fourth quarter of ‘09


versus positive earnings of $0.01 in the third quarter of ‘09.


As usual, the real story behind our earnings fluctuation is in the spread between what we paid for a


pound of copper versus what we were able to charge for wire that contained a pound of copper. As


Daniel highlighted earlier, our spreads were down dramatically year-over-year and also slid on a


sequential quarterly comparison. Informed investors who have followed our stock for some time


and understand the dynamics of this business have always focused on the spread as the key driver


of our earnings and also understand that LIFO adjustments are consistently applied under GAAP.


LIFO accounting merely serves to bring the latest cost of materials into the statements and allows


these spreads to be accurately included in our results.


Our low-cost structure continues to enable us to produce earnings in these turbulent times. Our


balance sheet remains strong. We ended 2009 with $226.8 million in cash on December 31, and


$100 million of debt on our senior notes. As we announced previously on a press release on


January 15, 2010, we paid off the entire balance of the senior notes and are now debt free, leaving


us with over $100 million in cash and our $150 million revolving line of credit untapped. We also


declared our 13th consecutive quarterly cash dividend during the quarter.
