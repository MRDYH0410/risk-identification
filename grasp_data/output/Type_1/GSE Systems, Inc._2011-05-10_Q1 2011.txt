Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the GSE Systems First Quarter 2011 Financial Results


Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer


session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Devin Sullivan, Senior Vice President for The


Equity Group. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. You may begin.


Devin Sullivan, Senior Vice President, The Equity Group Inc.


Thank you, Manny, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.


Before we begin, I’d like to remind everyone that statements made during the course of this call


may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities


Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These


statements reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results. Words such as


expect, intend, believe, may, will, should, could, anticipate and similar expressions are words that


are used to identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean a statement is not


forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to


risks and uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual performance or


achievements to be materially different from those projected.


For a full discussion of these risks, uncertainties and factors, you are encouraged to read GSE’s


documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those set forth in


periodic reports filed under the forward-looking statements and risk factors section. GSE does not


intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information,


future events or otherwise.


I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Eberle, Chief Executive Officer of GSE Systems. Please


go ahead, Jim.


Jim Eberle, Chief Executive Officer


Good afternoon. I’d like to welcome each of you to GSE Systems 2011 first quarter conference call.


I’m joined today by our CFO, Jeff Hough; and Larry Gordon, our Senior Vice President and General


Counsel.


This afternoon we issued a release covering our financial results for the first quarter and $5.3


million in new contract wins. I’ll make my prepared remarks brief, so we can get right to your


questions.


We are encouraged by our results for the first quarter and our continuing success in winning new


business. These developments not only reflect the health of GSE during some challenging times,


but as importantly validate our belief that the results in the fourth quarter of 2010 were truly an


aberration.


Challenges remain, specifically, the expected lingering negative margin impact in 2011 associated


with a large overseas energy customer, which is close to being resolved, and the simulation project


in Slovakia due to the significant hardware portion of this contract. These projects are expected to


wind down by the first quarter of 2012 and we expect that their impact will to some extent be offset

by new business we have won and expect to win throughout 2011. Year-to-date, and taking into


account, today’s announcement, we have won approximately $15 million of new contracts in 2011.


Revenue in the first quarter of 2011 rose to $12.3 million, up from $11.2 million in the first quarter of


2010 driven by the acquisitions of TAS Engineering Consultants and GSE EnVision, formerly


known a EnVision Systems.


Gross profit improved on both a dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue due to higher total


revenue and a $500,000 decline in revenue associated with the Slovakian project. In the first


quarter 2011, Slovakian revenue comprised 14.2% of total revenue, as compared to 19.9% of total


revenue in the first quarter of 2010.


As previously reported, this $23.8 million project carries a lower margin because the impact


associated with the $16.4 million hardware portion of the contract, the largest portion of which is a


Siemens digital control system.


Excluding approximately $200,000 of non-recurring acquisition-related costs, we had a modest


operating loss in the first quarter of 2011 of just under $100,000, compared to operating income of


about $450,000 in the first quarter of 2010, driven primarily by a $1.1 million increase in operating


expenses.


The initial increase is due to $773,000 of operating expenses incurred by the recently acquired TAS


Engineering Consultants and GSE EnVision, including charges of $146,000 due to the change in


the fair value of the contingent liability related to these acquisitions and $217,000 from amortization


of the intangible assets acquired; a $197,000 increase in business development costs; a $100,000


increase in cost incurred related to acquisition efforts, and approximately $50,000 for the creation of


a 3-D visualization team to develop gaming features to enhance GSE’s training solutions.


I’ll take a minute to discuss the 3-D team we’ve assembled. Case studies demonstrate that the


inclusion of “serious” gaming technology such as immersive 3-D environment can reduce training


time and improve learning significantly. In fact, the Royal Canadian Army was able to reduce the


cost of training and increase the pass rate of students by incorporating gaming into their curriculum.


Due to the advancement of computer processing power and graphic technology, immersive 3-D


game engines are readily available off the shelf at commercially viable prices. Additionally, this kind


of learning lends itself to the next generation workforce, and as such GSE is investing significantly


in 3-D visualization. This investment comes in the form of strategic hires, research and


development and investment in technology.


Through research and development efforts already undertaken, GSE’s engineers have discovered


how to link our industry-leading high fidelity models to commercial off-the-shelf game engines. This


enables us to make the invisible visible, for example, seeing the inside of an operating reactor,


steam generator or turbine generator.


Learning new earning strategy by incorporating 3-D visualization will allow GSE to provide the


energy industry with better, faster, less costly, training ideally suited for the next generation


workforce.


We expect modest revenues from 3-D visualization sales in 2011, and we expect to scale


dramatically over the coming years. A $600,000 gain on derivative instruments resulted in a pre-tax


income of approximately $400,000, as compared to pre-tax income of about $166,000 in last year’s


first quarter, which included a $300,000 loss on derivative instruments. The benefit for income


taxes in Q1 2011 were $600,000, compared to a benefit of about $300,000 in the first quarter of


2010.
