MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining Encore Wire's Third Quarter Earnings Conference


Call. As a reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&A session at the


end of the call. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, President, so that we


can begin. Mr. Jones?


Daniel Jones, President & CEO


Thank you Kendra. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation's third quarter conference call. I am Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive


Officer of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer. Encore


Wire has just reported a very strong third quarter of '05, fueled by a high raw material cost we were


able to raise the price of our wire and increase margins while achieving company record sales for


the quarter and nine months. Our third quarter earnings of $0.48 per share, was the second best


quarterly earnings in the history of the company, improving strongly over the second quarter


earnings of $0.10 per share. Margins started improving late in the second quarter and gained


momentum during third quarter. Tight supplies of certain raw material in our industry are helping to


keep margins strong. The margin improvement in our industry is holding early in its fourth quarter


and we are hopeful that that will continue. Our plants ran very efficiently during the quarter,


enabling us to maintain low production costs. We are utilizing our manufacturing flexibility to


produce efficiently and to maintain seasonally lean inventory levels. Our general and administrative


costs remain extremely low. We continue to focus on tight cost controls for other operation. We are


pleased to report the construction of our new armored cable plant is on schedule. This financial


extension of our product line and has significant long-term potential to grow the sales and earnings


of Encore Wire. We continue to strive to improve margins, anyway possible from continuing to


resist gaining volume by cutting process, by focusing our customers attention on our innovative


products and superior order fill rates. We believe there is room for significant growth of our sales


and earnings in the future and we are very proud of Encore's achievements and the hard work our


employees and associates took forth to make it happen. Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer


will now discuss our financial results. Frank?


Frank Bilban, VP-Finance, CFO, and Treasurer & Secretary


Thank you Daniel. In a minute I will review Encore's financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review we would take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a


copy of Encore's press release covering our financial results. This release is available on the


Internet, or you can call Dourves Easterlin [ph] or me at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we begin, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question-and-answer period


that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be forward-looking. In


order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to identify each


particular statement as forward looking, we advise you that all such statements involves certain


risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed


today. I refer each of you to the company's SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed


discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Now for the financial results. Net sales in the third quarter of 2005 increased 30.8% to $207.5


million versus $158.6 million in the third quarter of 2004. The $207.5 million in sales represents a


new quarterly company record. Sales dollars increased primarily due to price increases for wires


sold in 2005. Net income in the third quarter of 2005 was $11.2 million compared to $6.4 million in


the third quarter of 2004. Fully diluted net income per share was $0.48 in the third quarter of 2005

compared to $0.27 in the same period of 2004. On a sequential quarter comparison, sales for the


third quarter of '05 increased 22.6% to 207.5 million, compared to 169.3 million during the second


quarter of 2005. Shipment volume, measured in copper pounds of wire sold, increased by 6.4% in


the third quarter of '05 versus the second quarter of '05. Net Income for the third quarter of '05


increased to 11.2 million versus 2.4 million in the second quarter of 2005. Diluted net income per


share was $0.48 in the third quarter of 2005, versus $0.10 in the second quarter of 2005.


Net sales for the first nine months of 2005 increased 12.8% to 513.9 million, compared to 455.7


million during the first nine months of 2004. The nine months sales in '05 also constitute a new


company record. Higher prices for building wires sold in 2005 account for the increase in net dollar


sales versus '04, offsetting a slight 2.4% decrease in unit volume year-over-year. We continue to


gain on last year's unit volume, which was very strong and had a record first quarter in '04. Net


income for the first nine months of 2005 was $14.7 million versus $26.9 million in the first nine


months of 2004. Fully diluted net income per share was $0.63 in the first nine months of 2005


versus $1.14 in the first nine months of 2004. Our debt balance increased by $14 million in the


quarter, driven by a working capital increase of $23.4 million and capital expenditures of $5.5


million. Our debt balance remained conservative with most of our revolver availability untapped with


low interest cost. We also would like everyone to know that this conference call will be available for


replay after the conclusion of this session. Anyone wishing to hear the taped replay should call 866-


206-0173 and enter the conference reference 159831#. I will now turn the floor over to Daniel


Jones, our President and CEO. Daniel?


Daniel Jones, President & CEO


Thank you. As Frank highlighted, Encore posted increased profits during the quarter and we


believe we are well positioned for future growth. We will now take questions from our listeners.
