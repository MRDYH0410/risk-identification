Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-

Devin Sullivan, Investor Relations, The Equity Group Inc.


Thank you, [ph] Manny. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we


begin, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during the course of this call may be


considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of


1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements


reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results. Words such as expect,


intend, believe, may, will, should, could, anticipate, and similar expressions are words that are used


to identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean a statement is not forward-

uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual performance or achievements to


be materially different from those projected.


For a full discussion of these risks, uncertainties and factors, you are encouraged to read GSE’s


documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those set forth in


periodic reports filed under the forward-looking statements and risk factors sections. GSE does not


intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information,


future events or otherwise.


I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Eberle, the Chief Executive Officer of GSE Systems.


Please go ahead, Jim.


James A. Eberle, Director, Chief Executive and Operating Officer


Good afternoon. I’d like to welcome each of you to GSE Systems 2010 fourth quarter and full year


financial results conference call. I’m joined today by our CFO, Jeff Hough; and Larry Gordon, our


Senior Vice President and General Counsel.


This afternoon we issued a release covering our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year


and news regarding $15 million in new contract wins. I’m sure that you have a number of questions,


so I’ll keep my prepared remarks brief, so we can get to the Q&A as quickly as possible. I’ll note,


we’ve filed our 10-K this afternoon.


We really did experience the impact of a perfect storm or, perhaps, better stated, imperfect storm in


the 2010 fourth quarter. Despite higher revenues, we reported a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.13


per share, due in large part to the $1.2 million loss related to an ongoing simulation project with a


large customer, the impact of lower margin revenues associated with our simulation projects in


Slovakia and $1.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.


I want to first address the $1.2 million loss related to the disagreements with the British utility


customer on a $4.7 million contract to provide a full-scope simulator replacement. The specific


issues involved the extent and composition of the simulator testing procedures, the scope of certain

plant systems being included in the simulator and the project schedule. We expect to complete the


remaining $2.8 million of revenue expected on this contract by the end of the first quarter in 2012.


Although these issues were resolved in early 2011, GSE is currently in negotiations with the


customer for additional funding. The costs associated with completing this project have significantly


increased and the negative impact on our margins will linger through 2011 and the first quarter


2012.


I want to stress that this was a unique situation for GSE. We believe that the issues surrounding


this disagreement are confined to this specific project and customer. We have also addressed the


internal causes that led to this disagreement and are confident that we will not encounter a situation


like this again.


Gross profit in the fourth quarter 2010 declined to $1.9 million, or 15.7% of revenues, from $2.7


million, or 24.6% of revenues, in the fourth quarter 2009. This was due primarily to the loss on the


British utility contract as well as the impact of lower margin revenues associated with the Slovak


reactor project.


In the fourth quarter of 2010, 18.9% of total revenue was comprised of revenue from the Slovak


reactor project as compared to 15.6% of the total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues


associated with this $23.8 million project carry a much lower margin because of the impact


associated with the $16.4 million hardware portion of the contract, the largest of portion of which is


a Siemens digital control system.


The operating loss for the fourth quarter 2010 increased to $2.1 million from $1.1 million in the


fourth quarter 2009, reflecting the above referenced issues and higher selling, general and


administrative costs. Higher SG&A was due primarily to the addition of TAS’ SG&A, which was


$495,000; $437,000 of expenses related to company’s acquisition efforts; a bad debt expense of


$249,000; and an increase in business development costs due to additional personnel of $112,000.


The net loss for the fourth quarter was $2.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a net


loss of $2.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter


2009, the company had determined that its investment in the Emirates Simulation Academy, LLC.


in the United Arab Emirates, of which GSE is a 10% owner, had been impaired, and the company


recognizes a $2.4 million charge.


Moving to the balance sheet; the company’s cash balance at December 31, 2010, was $26.6


million, or $1.40 per share on a basic and diluted basis. We used approximately $1.2 million of cash


in the first quarter 2011 related to the acquisition of EnVision.


I think it’s important to note that our commitment to prudent fiscal management and maintaining a


solid financial position has allowed us to deploy our capital in a way that we believe will


substantially enhance shareholder value without a significant associated debt burden.


Cash flow from operating activities at December 31, 2010 improved to $2.4 million from $326,000


for the year ended December 31, 2009. Backlog at December 31, 2010 was $55.9 million


compared to $59.1 million at September 30, 2010, and $53.9 million at December 31, 2009.


I want to take a moment to highlight the significant progress that GSE made in 2010 and early


2011. We won $47.4 million of new contract awards in 2010 in a variety of nuclear and non-nuclear


end markets; announced 2011 year-to-date awards totaling $9.5 million; expanded our non-nuclear


simulation and energy services by acquiring TAS Holdings and EnVision Systems; elevated our


industry profile via the feature of our VPanel full scope nuclear simulator and Jump Start training


program in the January 2011 issue of Nuclear News magazine; and realized a 100% pass rate on
