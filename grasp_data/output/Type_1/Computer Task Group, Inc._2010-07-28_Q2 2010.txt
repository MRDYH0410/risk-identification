MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the CTG’s Second


Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will


conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator


Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.


I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker Jim Culligan. Please go ahead.


James M. Culligan, Vice President, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your interest


in CTG. On the call today, we have CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt; and Brendan


Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Brendan are going to review


the results for the second quarter of 2010 and update you on the company’s strategy and outlook.


We’ll follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing our financial


results, you can access it at the company’s website, ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, and predictions for the


future, are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected.


Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the


forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings release as well as in the company’s SEC


filings. You can find those at our website or the SEC’s website at sec.gov. So please review the


forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion.


James R. Boldt, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this


morning for our second quarter earnings conference call. As you saw in our earnings release in the


second quarter of 2010 we were near the high end of our revenue guidance and we were at the


midpoint of our guidance for earnings per share.


In the second quarter we added 100 people or a 3% increase to our staff bringing our total head


count to 3200.


We continue to see strong demand for our services; the majority of which is coming from electronic


medical record projects and our U.S. staffing business.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the third quarter and the full year. But


first, I’m going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President


Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2010, CTG’s revenue was $81.1


million, an increase of 14.6 million or 22% from the second quarter of 2009. On a sequential basis,


revenue increased 3.4% compared with the trailing first quarter of 2010.

Solutions revenue in the second quarter 2010 was 26.3 million, $3.2 million or 13.8% higher than


last year’s second quarter. As a percentage of total revenue, solutions revenue was 32% compared


with 35% a year ago. Driven by a strong demand in the quarter, staffing revenue increased $11.4


million or 26.2% to 54.8 million.


Second quarter revenue from IBM, our largest customer, was $25.6 million, compared with 17.1


million in the same period last year. As a percent of total revenue, IBM increased to 31.5% in the


2010 second quarter, compared with 25.7% of total revenue in the second quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was $14.4 million, a 4% decrease from the $15 million


recorded in last year’s second quarter. Despite the fact that the recovery in Europe continues to lag


that of the US, excluding the foreign exchange fluctuations our European revenue in the quarter


would have increased 2.7% from last year. The effect of the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar during


the second quarter of 2010 decreased our revenue by approximately $1 million or 1.3% as


compared with the second quarter of 2009.


Second quarter operating income expanded at a greater rate than revenue and was $3.5 million up


almost $1.1 million or 44% year-over-year. Compared with the trailing first quarter of 2010, second


quarter operating income also increased by $400,000 or 12.9%.


Operating margin in the second quarter expanded to 4.3% of revenue, a 70 basis point


improvement from last year’s 3.6%. Our operating margin benefited from an increase in the


profitability of solutions projects and the additional operating leverage associated with the higher


revenue.


Net income was $1.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 36.6% from $1.4 million in the second


quarter of 2009. On a per diluted share basis net income was $0.12 for the quarter, a 33% increase


from second quarter 2009, and a 9% increase from the 2010 first quarter.


SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 17.6% from 18.8% in the second quarter


of 2009, and from 17.7% in the trailing first quarter of 2010. The significant improvement from last


year reflects the operating leverage from higher revenue and continued discipline in controlling


costs.


Direct costs as a percentage of revenue were 78.1% in the second quarter, compared with 77.5%


in the second quarter of 2009 and 78.3% in the trailing first quarter of 2010.


The 2010 second quarter results include equity compensation expense of approximately $0.02 per


diluted share net of tax, while the second quarter of 2009 results included approximately $0.01 per


diluted share net of tax.


The tax rate for the 2010 second quarter was 44.3% compared with 41.8% in the 2009 second


quarter. During the second quarter of 2010, the company incurred severance expense related to


downsizing one of its foreign subsidiaries. We’ve determined that the realizability of the tax benefit


of the losses incurred by that subsidiary in 2010 is uncertain. As a result of the uncertainty, we’ve


recorded a full valuation allowance against this taxable loss.


In addition, in 2010, the U.S. Federal Government has not extended the U.S. Federal Research


and Development Credit, which had in previous years reduced the company’s effective tax rate.


These two factors were the primary reasons that the 2010 second quarter tax rate was above our


normal range. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2010 to be between 39 and 41%. As Jim


noted, our head count has been increasing. We had approximately 3200 employees at the end of


Q2 2010, of which 90% were billable resources and that’s up slightly from 89% last quarter.
