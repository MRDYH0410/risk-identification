MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire Third Quarter Conference


Call. As a reminder, all phone lines are on listen-only mode and there will be time for questions and


answers towards the end. [Operator Instructions] And now to begin our call, I introduce Daniel


Jones, the President and CEO of Encore Wire. Please go ahead.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Matt, good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire Corporation


quarterly conference call. I am Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Encore


Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer. We are pleased to


announce strong quarterly earnings in the midst of the severe recession currently taking place in


the construction industry. As we have repeatedly noted, the key metric to our earnings is the spread


between the price of wire sold and cost of raw copper.


That spread increased 37.4% in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009. While our


unit volume shipped in the third quarter of 2010 increased 12.5% versus the third quarter of 2009.


The spread increased 28% on a year-to-date basis while unit volume decreased 6.7%. The results


in the last two quarters are particularly encouraging. We believe the exit of a former competitor in


the first quarter has had a positive impact on pricing levels and margins in the last two quarters. We


continue to strive to support industry price increases to maintain the momentum started during the


past two quarters.


We believe our superior order fill rates continued to enhance our competitive position, as our


electrical distributor customers are holding lean inventories in the field. As orders come in from


electrical contractors, the distributors can count on our order fill rates to ensure quick deliveries


from coast-to-coast. We have been able to accomplish this despite holding, what are historically


lean inventories for us. We believe our performance is impressive in this economy. We thank our


employees and associates for their tremendous efforts and we also thank our shareholders for their


continued support. Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer will now discuss our financial results,


Frank?


Frank J. Bilban, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank You, Daniel. In a minute we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review we will be happy to take any questions you may have. Each of you should have


received a copy of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. This release is also


available on the Internet or you can call Denise Liss at 800-962-9473 and we will be happy to get


you a copy.


Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question and


answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advice you that all such statements


involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today.


I would refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed


discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures


discussed during this conference call to the most directly comparable financial measures presented


in accordance with GAAP, including EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental


information for investors are posted on www.encorewire.com.

Now the financial results. Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010, were $242.8


million compared to $168.7 million during the third quarter of 2009. Higher prices for building wire


sold in the quarter ended September 30, 2010 accounted for most of the increase in net sales


dollars, increasing 27.9% per copper pound sold versus the same period in 2009.


Sales prices rose primarily due to higher copper prices. Unit volume in the third quarter of 2010


increased 12.5% versus the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the third quarter of 2010


increased 1,467.3% to $5.1 million versus $300,000 in the third quarter of 2009. Fully diluted net

compared to $472.5 million during the same period in 2009.


Higher prices for building wires sold in the nine months ended September 30th accounted for the


increase in net sales dollars, increasing 48.3% per copper pound versus the same period in 2009.

period in 2009. Net income for the nine months ended September 30th, 2010 were 10.8 million

On a sequential quarter comparison net sales for the third quarter of 2010 was $242.8 million


versus $236.1 million during the second quarter of 2010. Unit volume is virtually unchanged,


decreasing 0.1% on a sequential quarter comparison. Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was


$5.1 million versus $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2010. Fully diluted net income per common


share was $0.22 in the third quarter of 2010 versus $0.35 in the second quarter of 2010.


Our balance sheet is very strong. We have no long-term debt and our revolving line of credit is paid


down to zero. In addition, we have $90.4 million in cash as of September 30th, 2010. We also


declared another quarterly cash dividend during the third quarter of 2010.


Finally, we want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the


conclusion of this session. If you wish to hear this taped replay, please call 866-551-4520 and enter
