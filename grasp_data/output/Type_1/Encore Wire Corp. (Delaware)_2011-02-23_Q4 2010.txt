MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome today’s Fourth Quarter Earnings


Conference Call. Please note that all your lines are in listen-only mode and there will be time for a


Q&A session towards the conclusion of this meeting. [Operator Instructions]


And now to start off today’s conference, I’d like to welcome and turn the call over to Mr. Daniel


Jones, President and CEO. Go ahead, sir.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Mona. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive Officer


of Encore Wire and with me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer.


We’re pleased to announce strong quarterly earnings in the midst of the severe recession currently


taking place in the construction industry.


As we have repeatedly noted, the key metric to our earnings is the spread between the average


price of wire sold per copper pound and the company’s average cost of raw copper per pound in


any given period. That spread increased 59.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus the fourth


quarter of 2009, while our unit volume shipped in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 6% versus


the fourth quarter of 2009.


The spread increased 32.5% on a year-over-year basis while unit volume decreased 3.8%, driving


the increase in our earnings despite the decreased unit volume. The results in the last three


quarters are particularly encouraging, following the losses we sustained in the fourth quarter of


2009 and the first quarter of 2010. After earning $0.05 per share in the five quarters ended March


31, 2010, the company earned $0.77 per share in the last three quarters of 2010.


We believe the exit of a former competitor in the first quarter of 2010 has contributed to the positive


trend in the industry pricing levels and margins over the last three quarters. We continue to strive to


support industry price increases to maintain the momentum started during the past two quarters.


We believe our superior order fill rates continue to enhance our competitive position, as our


electrical distributor customers are holding lean inventories in the field.


As our orders come in from electrical contractors, the distributors can count on our order fill rates to


ensure quick deliveries from coast to coast. We’ve been able to accomplish this despite holding


what are historically lean inventory levels for us. We believe our performance is impressive in this


economy. We thank our employees and associates for their tremendous efforts. We also thank our


shareholders for their continued support.


Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer will now discuss our financial results. Frank?


Frank J. Bilban, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute, we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a


copy of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. This release is available on the


Internet or you can call Tracey West at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question-and-


answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be

forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advice you that all such statements


involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today.


I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed discussion


of these risks and uncertainties. Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed


during this conference call to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in


accordance with GAAP, including EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information


for investors are posted on www.encorewire.com.


Moving on to the financial results. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010


increased 44.6% to $256.1 million compared to $177.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2009.


Unit sales in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010 increased 6% versus the fourth quarter


of 2009, while the average price per pound for building wire sold in the quarter increased by 36.3%.


Sales prices rose primarily due to higher copper prices. Copper prices rose 30.8% in the same


period comparison.


Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased to $4.5 million versus a net loss of $1.9 million


in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were a positive $0.19 in


the fourth quarter of 2010 versus a loss of $0.08 in the fourth quarter of 2009.


Net sales for the year ending December 31, 2010 increased 40.1% to $910.2 million compared to


$649.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.


The average price per copper pound of building wire sold in the quarter increased by 45.8%, driving


increase in net sales dollars. Unit volume in the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 3.8%


versus the year of 2009.


Net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 320.6% to $15.3 million versus $3.6


million in 2009. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.66 for the year ended


December 31, 2010 versus $0.16 in 2009.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $256.1 million


versus $242.8 million during the third quarter of 2010. Unit volume decreased 8.7% on a sequential


quarter comparison, while the average selling price of wire increased 15.6%.


Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $4.5 million versus $5.1 million in the third quarter of


2010. Fully diluted net income per common share was $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus


$0.22 in the third quarter of 2010.


Our balance sheet remains strong. We have no long-term debt and our revolving line of credit is


paid down to zero. In addition, we had $103.3 million in cash as of December 31, 2010. We also


declared another quarterly cash dividend during the fourth quarter of 2010.


This conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion of the session. If you wish to
