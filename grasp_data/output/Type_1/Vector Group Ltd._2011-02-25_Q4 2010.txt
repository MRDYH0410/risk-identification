MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Welcome to the Vector Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Conference


Call. Before the call begins, I’d like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth and are implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing.


Now, I’d like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber. You may begin, sir.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us on Vector Group’s fourth quarter and full


year 2010 earnings conference call. With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and Chief


Executive Officer of Liggett Vector Brands and Liggett; and Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group’s Chief


Financial Officer.


On today’s call I’ll provide an update on our business and review Vector Group’s financials for the


fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2010. Ron will then discuss Liggett’s performance


-- period and provide his views on the industry developments, and the competitive environment.


After that, we will answer your questions.


Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our company’s overall performance and


particularly with our volume and share growth in 2010. As we have noted, we made the decision to


strategically invest in the growth of our tobacco business in advance of the April 2009 legislation


that increased the federal excise tax on cigarettes by $6.17 per carton and legislation that ultimately


granted the Food and Drug Administrations regulatory authority over tobacco products.


The success of the strategy that we put into place is reflected in LVB’s fourth quarter 2010


wholesale shipment growth of almost 17% compared to the year ago quarter. And for the 2010 full


year we received wholesale shipment growth of almost 25%.


Looking longer-term, we remain committed to achieving sustainable profitable growth in our


tobacco business and Ron will provide more detail on that in a moment.


With respect to real estate, we continue to see positive signs in a challenging but improving market


environment. We are very pleased Douglas Elliman’s record EBITDA of $43.5 million and net


income of $41.5 million for 2010. We continue to believe that there are good investment


opportunities in this market, and we are pursuing appropriate opportunities that meet our criteria.


Before turning to the financials, I want to briefly address the tobacco litigation environment and


specifically developments with respect to the Engle cases in Florida. As previously noted, the Engle


progeny cases are now the primary focus on our litigation activity.


There are approximately 6,800 cases pending, with more than half of them in Federal Court and the


balance in Florida State Court. We along with the other industry defendants continue to believe that


the Engle process is materially flawed and unconstitutional.


While we believe that we have strong arguments, as is evidenced by several recent defense


verdicts in the state cases and a potentially favorable ruling in Federal Court that we referenced on

previous calls, there is still considerable risk, and we remain subject to the ongoing process and


periodic negative judgments.


As previously reported in June 2010, we paid $14.4 million to resolve the judgment in the Lukacs


case, which was the first Engle progeny case tried. Although the verdict was rendered years in


advance of the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling on the Engle case, which overturned certain findings


that the jury in Lukacs relied upon in assessing liability, the Appellate Court chose not to review this


case. This is the largest judgment against Liggett to-date, and is the result of what we believe to be


unique circumstances.


The Federal Court ruling from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals we’ve referenced, impacts


approximately 3700 Engle progeny cases pending in Federal Court. While we continue to believe


the court’s rulings will result in restrictions on the ability of plaintiffs in Federal Court to use Phase I


findings determined by the prior Engle jury to meet their burden of proof at trial, a recent appellate


decision in State Court ruled that the Federal Appellate Court decision is not persuasive authority in


the State Court.


Turning now to Vector’s balance sheet, our liquidity remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents


of approximately $300 million as of December 31, 2010.


During the 2010 first quarter – fourth quarter, we saw strong demand among qualified institutional


buyers from Vector Group’s 11% senior secured notes due 2015 and thus up-sized the offering size


from $75 million to $90 million. The notes were issued at a premium 1.03 of face value.


At year-end 2010, the company held investment securities and partnership interest with a fair


market value of approximately $151 million.


Before we review Group’s – Vector Group’s financial performance, there was a press release that


was issued, which has to be – which we’re sending out a correction, two numbers in the table that


was in the release that was given out yesterday. More importantly, these numbers do not change


any of the totals, and we will be issuing a correction momentarily. The correct number for the gain


on investment securities for the quarter is $8.05 million, and the correct number for the equity


income from non-consolidated real estate business is $5.125 million. We apologize for any


confusion.


During the fourth quarter we, excuse me, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, Vector


Group’s revenues were $277.6 million, compared to $236.7 million in the 2009 fourth quarter. The


increase in revenues in the 2010 period was primarily due to increased cigarette unit volume. The


company recorded operating income of $29.3 million in the 2010 fourth quarter, compared to


operating income of $36.2 million in the 2009 fourth quarter.


Fourth quarter 2010 net income was $12 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $13.4


million or $0.18 per diluted share in the corresponding 2009 period.


Excluding a $1.8 million pre-tax charge for litigation judgment and $1.2 million of pre-tax charges


from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within our convertible debt, fourth quarter 2010


net income was $13.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share.


Excluding $10.1 million of pre-tax charges from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded


within our convertible debt, which was offset by $2.1 million of pre-tax income from our investment


in the St. Regis Hotel, fourth quarter 2009 net income was $18.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share.


For the full year ended December 31, 2010, Vector Group revenues were $1.063 billion, compared


to $801.5 million for the full year 2009. The increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily due to
