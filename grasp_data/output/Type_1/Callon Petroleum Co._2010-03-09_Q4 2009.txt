MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Full


Year 2009 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the


conference over to Mr. Fred Callon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.


Fred L. Callon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning and thank you for taking time to call in to our 2009 Fourth Quarter and


Year-End Results Conference Call. Before we begin the formal portion of our presentation this


morning, I’d like to ask Terry Trovato, who heads our Investor Relations, to make a few comments.


Terry Trovato, Investor Relations


Thank you, Fred. We’d like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call


will be considered forward-looking statements. As such, no assurances can be given that these


events will occur or that the projections will be attained. Please refer to the cautionary language


included in our news release, and in the risk factors described in our SEC filings. We undertake no


obligation to publicly update or revise such forward-looking statements. It is also important to note


that the SEC permits us, in our filings with them, to disclose only proved reserves that we have


demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally


producible under existing economic and operating conditions. During today’s discussion we may


use terms like reserve potential and probable reserves, that the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit us


from using in our filings with them. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than


estimates of proved reserves, and accordingly, are subject to a substantially greater risk of being


actually realized by the company.


Finally, today will be discussion 2009 cash flow, which is considered a non-GAAP financial


measure. Reconciliation and calculation schedules for the non-GAAP financial measure were


stated in our fourth quarter 2009 results news release, and can be referenced there on our web site


at www.callon.com for subsequent review. Fred?


Fred L. Callon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Terry, and again, we appreciate you calling in this morning. Callon entered 2009 with a


new strategic focus, looking to emphasize long-term growth through the acquisition and


development of low-risk, high-impact onshore assets, and funding the development of these new


assets primarily with the stable cash flow from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties. Our two


onshore acquisitions in 2009 are the first steps in achieving these objectives. Maintaining liquidity


during the company’s strategic shift towards onshore growth was a major focus throughout much of


2009, and we have significantly improved our balance sheet and liquidity position.


I’d like to begin this morning by asking Steve Hinchman, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss our


operations, including our recently announced acquisitions in the Permian Basin and the Haynesville


Shale play, and to review our operations for fourth quarter and full-year of 2009. Bob Weatherly,


our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year


2009, and also the events leading to our improved balance sheet and liquidity position, which are


significant positive developments for the shareholders, and a catalyst for future growth


opportunities. Steve?

Steven B. Hinchman, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer


Thank you, Fred, and good morning. Let me begin by highlighting our 2009 major operating


accomplishments, beginning with safety. Safety is a top priority; it reflects the character of an


organization. I’m very proud of Callon’s safety performance, having had zero employee and


contractor OSHA-recordable incidents in 2009. In 2009, Callon set its course and began its


transformation. We recognized that continuing to solely focus on the Gulf of Mexico shelf and


deepwater could not sustain profitable growth at an acceptable level of risk. We needed to initiate a


transition of Callon’s resources from offshore to a more diverse and lower-risk resource base


located both onshore and offshore. We would focus our attention on the Permian Basin for oil and


the shale gas plays.


During the fourth quarter of 2009 we closed our initial entry into the Permian Basin with the


acquisition of ExL’s Wolfberry production and development potential, and we began to build an


acreage position in a de-risked area of the Haynesville shale gas play. These additions alone


already have begun to positively reshape Callon’s portfolio and outlook.


In 2009 Callon increased its proven reserves to 58 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent, a 6%


increase over year-end 2008. We added 15 Bcf of gas equivalent of proven reserves and replaced


127% of our 2009 production. We received MMS approval to reclassify the temporary


abandonment status of two Entrada exploration wells to a permanent abandonment, saving up to


18 million in abandonment expenditures planned for 2010.


And we delivered on what we said. We produced 32.4 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day


compared to our first of year guidance of 27 to 35 million gas equivalent per day. Our lease


operating expense including severance was 18.4 million compared to our first of year guidance of


17 to 22 million. And our abandonment costs totaled 5.7 million compared to our estimate of six to


nine million.


Now, turning to our quarterly and annual comparisons for 2009. Our production averaged 35.4


million cubic feet equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter 2009


production was comprised of 1.52 Bcf of natural gas and 288,000 barrels of oil. Production in the


fourth quarter of 2008 was 0.93 Bcf of gas and 162,000 barrels of oil or 20.7 million cubic feet gas


equivalent per day. The positive variance in the fourth quarter of 2009 is due to the addition of


Medusa royalty volumes produced between January and September of 2009 and hurricane


downtime that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 that was associated with Gustav and Ike.


Callon suspended MMS royalty payments beginning in September of 2009 following the United


States District Court’s upholding that the MMS exceeded Congressional authority to pay royalties


based on price thresholds in regard to the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. The adjustment


in the fourth quarter considered those royalty volumes produced in January through August of


2009.


If we had continued to pay royalty, the fourth quarter production would have been 31.4 million cubic


feet of gas equivalent per day. Production in the third quarter of 2009 was 1.34 Bcf of gas, and


197,000 barrels of oil, or 27.4 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The positive variance in


the fourth quarter of 2009 is again due to the adjustment for 2009 MMS royalty volumes at Medusa,


and production from the Permian Basin following the October 2009 closing, and High Island A-494


which came on production in July of 2009.


For the full year, our production averaged 32.4 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, or 5.7


Bcf of gas and one million barrels of oil, and compares favorably to the guidance provided in the


third quarter of 29 to 32 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. On the expense side, lease


operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 4.8 million, or $1.47 per Mcf equivalent. Lease


operating expense for the fourth quarter 2008 was 5.5 million, or $2.87 per Mcf equivalent. The
