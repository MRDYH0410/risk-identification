MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the CTG Conference


Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for


questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this


conference is being recorded.


I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Investor Relations for CTG, Ms. Deborah


Pawlowski. Please go ahead.


Deborah K. Pawlowski, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning, everyone and welcome to CTG third quarter 2010


earnings conference call. We certainly appreciate your time and interest in CTG.


On the call today are CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt and Senior Vice President and Chief


Financial Officer, Brendan Harrington. Jim and Brendan are going to review the results for the third


quarter and update you on the Company’s strategy and outlook. We will follow that with an


opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing our financial results, you can


access it at the Company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the Company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the Company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected.


Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the


forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings release as well as in the Company’s SEC


filings. You can find these at our website or at the SEC’s website, sec.gov. So please review our


forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Debbie and good morning everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us


this morning for our third quarter earnings conference call.


As you saw in our earnings release in the third quarter of 2010, we surpassed the upper end of our


revenue guidance and achieved the high end of our guidance for earnings per share. We continue


to grow as demand for our services expands both as a result of the continued need in the United


States for staffing and as the healthcare industry invests in electronic medical records systems.


As a result in the third quarter, we added 200 people, a 6% increase to our staff, bringing our total


head count to 3,400. Year-to-date, we’ve added 500 staff to our head count for an increase of 17%.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the fourth quarter and the full year, but


first I’m going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial statements. Brendan?

Brendan M. Harrington, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Head – Investor


Relations


Thanks, Jim. Good morning. For the third quarter of 2010, CTG’s revenue grew to 84.5 million, an


increase of 17.7 million or 26% from the third quarter of 2009. On a sequential basis, revenue


increased 4.1% compared with the second quarter 2010. Solutions revenue in the third quarter of


2010 was 28.5 million, $5.5 million or 24% higher than last year’s third quarter. As a percentage of


total revenue, solutions revenue was 34%, the same as a year ago and up from 32% in the 2010


second quarter.


Driven by a strong demand in the quarter, staffing revenue increased 12.2 million or 27.9% to 56


million. Third quarter revenue from IBM, our largest customer, was 27.2 million, an increase of 58%


or $10 million compared with last year’s third quarter. As a percent of total revenue, IBM increased


to 32.2% in the quarter and has now returned to the level we experienced prior to the recent


economic downturn. In the third quarter of 2009, revenue from IBM was 25.8% of total revenue.


Revenue from our European operations was 13.8 million, down 6.6% from the 14.8 million recorded


in last year’s third quarter. The recovery in the European economy continues to lag that of the U.S.


and that continues to be reflected in our European revenues.


Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, European revenue in the quarter would have increased


3.2% from last year. The effect of the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of 2010


decreased our consolidated revenue by approximately $1.5 million or 1.7%.


Direct costs as a percentage of revenue were 79.5% in the third quarter compared with 77.2% in


the third quarter of 2009 and 78.1% in the trailing second quarter of 2010. Our direct profit margin


was negatively impacted in the third quarter by the significant increase in our staffing revenue,


especially from our lower direct margin staffing business. However, this lower than average direct


margin managed staffing business has a significantly lower SG&A cost than our solutions business.


This is reflected in the favorable impact on our overall SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue,


which decreased to 16.8% from 19% in the third quarter of 2009 and from 17.6% in the second


quarter of 2010.


Also adversely affecting direct profit margin in the quarter was the revenue recognition method


required for our software sales. On projects where we are engaged to deliver both software and


services, the revenue recognized is limited to the extent of the costs incurred until the software has


been modified as necessary and then accepted by the client.


Once the software has been modified and accepted, we will then recognize profit ratably over the


remaining term of these engagements. Under the current accounting guidelines, this revenue


recognition policy is required until we are able to establish an objective price in the marketplace for


the particular software being delivered.


Third quarter operating income was 3.1 million, up $629,000 or 25% year-over-year. Compared


with the trailing second quarter, our third quarter operating income decreased by 372,000 or 10.6%.


The contraction in the margin from 4.3% in the 2010 second quarter reflects higher than expected


growth in the lower margin managed staffing business, and the decline in utilization rates normally


seen in the third quarter due to vacation time taken by the billable staff. Operating margin in the


third quarter of 2010 was 3.7%, which was equal to last year’s third quarter margin of 3.7%.


Net income increased $421,000 to $2 million in the quarter, an increase of 26.2%. On a per diluted


share basis, net income was $0.13 for the quarter, a 30% increase from third quarter 2009 and an


8.3% increase from the 2010 second quarter.
