MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello, and welcome to Vector Group’s Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call.


Before the call begins, I’d like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.


I’d now like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber. You may begin, sir.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s second quarter 2009


earnings conference call. With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of Liggett Vector


Brands and Liggett, and Bryant Kirkland, Vector’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call, I will provide an overview of our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the second quarter and the first half of 2009. Ron will then discuss the performance of Liggett


Group and Vector Tobacco for the period and provide an update on industry developments and the


competitive environment. After that we will take your questions.


Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with the second quarter earnings performance of our


conventional tobacco business as we work our way through an evolving marketplace. As noted on


our previous call, effective April 1, 2009 the federal excise tax on cigarettes was increased by $6.17


per carton to fund the State Children’s Health Insurance or SCHIP legislation.


While we anticipated that this extraordinary tax increase would have an impact on our earnings in


the second quarter and throughout the year, we performed quite well in the quarter bringing our


tobacco related earnings to within 1% of the second quarter of 2008 strong earnings results. We


continue to believe that the changing industry landscape presents some distinct opportunities for


us, and Ron will cover those in more detail following my review of Vector Group’s financial results.


Before discussing the financial results for the quarter, I am pleased to report that Vector was able to


successfully complete an exchange of approximately $100 million of senior convertible notes.


Specifically, we issued approximately 106.9 million in 6.75% Variable Interest Senior Convertible


Exchange Notes due 2014 in exchange for 99.9 million of our 5% Variable Interest Senior


Convertible Notes due 2011.


The new notes are convertible into shares of the Vector’s common stock at a conversion price of


$17.06 per share. This is a positive development for Vector and further enhances our strong


financial position as new notes have an extended maturity and a lower cash interest cost. This


comes on the heels of our completion in May of a $50 million private placement of convertible notes


with an affiliate of Dr. Phillip Frost, one of our countries most successful entrepreneurs. In


connection with the debt transactions, we’ve recognized a pre-tax non-cash charge on


extinguishments of debt of approximately 18.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30,


2009.


In addition, due primarily to the narrowing of credit spreads in both the U.S. corporate credit


markets and the market for the company’s debt in 2009, we’ve recognized pre-tax non-cash


charges related to increases in the fair values of derivatives embedded within our convertible debt


of 19.5 million and 19.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. Our liquidity

remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $232.5 million as of June 30,


2009. In addition, as of June 30, 2009, we held investment securities and partnership interest with a


fair market value of approximately $105.3 million.


Now, let’s turn to the key financials for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2009 for


Vector Group. In addition to the non-cash charges related to our convertible debt discussed above,


our financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2009 included a pre-tax gain of $5 million


related to the 1999 Trademark transaction with Philip Morris, which was offset by pre-tax


impairment charges of 8.5 million on real estate and pre-tax restructuring charges of one million.


Our financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2008 include 9.8 million in gains from the


fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt. Our financial results for the six months


ended June 30, 2008 include 12 million of pre-tax income from the St. Regis hotel and 7.3 million in


gains from the fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt.


Back to the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, Vector Group revenues were 206.8 million,


compared to 143.0 million in the 2008 second quarter. The company recorded operating income of


38.8 million in the 2009 second quarter, compared to operating income of 34.3 million in the 2008


second quarter.


Second quarter 2009 net income was a loss of 7.9 million or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to


net income of 19.1 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the 2008 period. Adjusting for the non-cash


charges to the company’s convertible debt previously discussed, second quarter 2009 net income


was 14.7 million or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to 13.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share.


For the six months ended June 30, 2009 Vector Group’s revenues were 328 million, compared to


275.2 million in the first six months of 2008. The company recorded operating income of 70 million


in the 2009 second quarter, compared to operating income of 62.4 million for the 2008 period. Net


income was a loss of 4.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of 33.4 million


or $0.49 per diluted share in the 2008 period.


Excluding the non-cash charges related to the company’s convertible debt previously discussed,


the gain on the Trademark transaction and the impairment losses and restructuring charges in the


2009 period, the company’s net income for the first six months of 2009 was 20.7 million or $0.30


per diluted share. Excluding the income from the St. Regis Hotel and the non-cash gains related to


the company’s convertible debt previously discussed, the company’s net income for the first six


months of 2008 was 22 million or $0.32 per diluted share.


Now, I will turn the call over Ron Bernstein for a review of our tobacco subsidiaries. Liggett’s


numbers reflect sales for both Liggett Group’s cigarettes and conventional cigarette products from


Vector Tobacco. Ron?


Ronald J. Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Liggett Group Inc. and Liggett


Vector Brands Inc.


Thanks, Howard. Good morning everybody. As Howard noted, we’re very pleased with our second


quarter performance in the face of the extraordinary $6.17 per carton federal excise tax increase on


cigarettes that became effective on April 1. As we anticipated, the largest federal tax or fee


increase on tobacco in history had an impact on Liggett and the rest of the industry during the


quarter, and we expect it will continue to do so going forward.


To give you the proper context, I think it’s important to recount the events of 2009. On February 9,


the industry leader announced a price increase of $0.90 per carton on its major brands. This was


then followed with a $7.10 per carton increase on March 9. The remainder of the big three followed
