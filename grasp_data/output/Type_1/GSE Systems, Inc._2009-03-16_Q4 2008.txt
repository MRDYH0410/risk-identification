MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the GSE Systems Conference Call. Today’s


conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. John V. Moran.


Please go ahead, sir.


John V. Moran, Chief Executive Officer


Okay, thank you. Welcome everyone to GSE’s first year-end conference call. I’m John Moran,


GSE’s CEO, and I’m joined here today by our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Hough. We’ve decided to


initiate what will be a twice per year conference call format partly due to the growth and maturity of


our business over the past 18 months or so. And as a result, the increasing interest we’re


generating from the financial community. Our next planned call will coincide with the release of our


June 30 financials.


Before we begin, I’d like to turn it over to Jeff Hough to address the subject of forward-looking


statements.


Jeffery G. Hough, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, John. This presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding the future


performance of GSE Systems Inc. that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual


results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, customer demand,


increased competition in the relevant market and others. We refer you to the documents that the


company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the Form


10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K report, which contain additional important factors that could cause


actual results to differ from its current expectations and from the forward-looking statements made


in this presentation.


John V. Moran, Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Jeff. Okay, let’s begin. Today’s call will begin with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and


year-end 2008 financials. That will be followed by an overview of our nuclear simulation, non-


nuclear simulation and our training and education business sectors. Since this is our first call and


I’m sure we have a number of listeners that are new to the GSE opportunity, I’ll also provide a bit of


history on each of these three business sectors in addition to our current activities and outlook for


each. We’ll conclude with some comments and a general outlook for 2009 and followed by about


30 minutes for any questions that you might have.


Okay, let’s start with the financial summary. As noted in our press release, the company reported


that revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2008 was $8.4 million, that’s a 3% increase


from the revenue reported for the three months ended December 31, 2007 of $8.1 million. GSE


reported operating income of $140,000 for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to operating


income of $522,000 for the fourth quarter of 2007. The net loss for the December 31, 2008 quarter


was $69,000 or $0.00 per share on both a basic and diluted basis as compared to net income of


487,000 or $0.03 a share on both a basic and diluted basis for the fourth quarter of 2007.


GSE reported revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 of $29 million, a 9% decrease


from the revenue reported for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 of $31.9 million. In 2008,


the company generated $15.7 million or about 54% of our total revenue from nuclear simulation,

$11.7 million or 40% of total revenue from non-nuclear simulation, and 1.6 million or about 6% of


the total revenue from our training and educational services.


GSE reported an operating loss of $12,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 as


compared to operating income of 2.2 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007. The


company incurred a net loss attributed to shareholders, that is arrived at by deducting the preferred


stock dividends from net income, of $690,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 or


$0.04 per share on a basic and diluted basis compared to net income of $1.1 million or $0.09 per


share on a basic basis and $0.08 per share on a diluted basis for the 12 months ended December


31, 2007.


Now the company utilizes derivative instruments, specifically forward foreign exchange contracts, to


manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on


foreign-denominated trade receivables. The purpose and structure of these derivative instruments


GSE has entered into are designed to protect the contract value and margins at the time the


contracts are signed and are not designed to speculate on the direction of any currency up or


down.


For the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2008, the company incurred a 288,000


and $453,000 pre-tax non-cash loss respectively on its derivative instruments. Excluding these


losses from our 2008 results, the company would have incurred net income of $106,000 for the


three months ended December 31, 2008 or $0.01 per share on both a basic and diluted basis and


would have incurred a net loss of $350,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 or $0.02


per share on both a basic and diluted basis.


GSE’s backlog as of December 31, 2008, was approximately $38 million compared to 24.6 million


at December 31, 2007. Backlog is defined as the remaining value of signed contracts and does not


include any value for contracts being negotiated or for contracts that have been signed since


December 31, 2008. Therefore, the backlog of $38 million does not include the expected total value


of the two new full scope simulators for a Japanese customer nor the expected total value of the full


scope nuclear simulator currently being built for Westinghouse Electric’s Haiyang project in China.


Now let me take a minute to clarify this last point. In the case of the Japanese contracts, the


customer’s procurement process is to first select a simulator vendor, negotiate a final price and


schedule and then issue a small contract to begin work. Final terms and conditions are then agreed


upon and a contract amendment is issued for the full amount of the contract. We expect this last


step to be completed sometime this summer, at which point the full value of the contract will be


reflected in contract backlog.


In the case of the Haiyang simulator, a portion of the plant’s design has not yet been finalized and


so the final price of the simulator cannot be determined. However, the customer wanted to select a


simulator vendor and begin work in parallel with the design being finalized. In this case, the


customer issued a small contract to begin work and will issue a contract amendment for the full


value of the contract once the design is finalized. This should occur at some point during 2009. In


both cases, we know what the approximate full value of the contracts will be.


What’s important to understand here is that we’ve been authorized to begin work on these projects


and are booking revenue on the initial portions of the work no differently than if the total amounts


were in our official backlog. The total estimated remaining value of the Japanese and Haiyang


projects not in backlog is estimated to be over $14 million bringing our “implied backlog” to over 52


million at December 31, 2009, the highest implied backlog in the company’s recent history. And


again this number does not include any of the new business that we’ve announced since December


31.
