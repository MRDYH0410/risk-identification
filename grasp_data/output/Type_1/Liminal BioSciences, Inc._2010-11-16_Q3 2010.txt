Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. On slide 3, the usual Safe Harbor statement where this


presentation do contain forward-looking statement about ProMetic objectives, strategies, and business that


involve risks and uncertainties.

regarding the future of the business and how management is working on a number of initiatives to bring

these deals in the coming weeks, and at this time commit to a further call before year-end to update on progress.

markets outside China, and Allist, obviously, to fund clinical development to regulatory approval in China. So we'll


cover more on that agreement and what it means to ProMetic.

weeks and months, and in spite of lower revenue, protein technologies business does continue to contribute to
