Thank you for joining us today. We had a strong third quarter with record quarterly revenue of $142


million, up $16 million or 13% from Q3 last year. GAAP Net income was $14.4 million with fully


diluted GAAP earnings per share of 18 cents, up from 10 cents in Q3 2004. Net margin was 10%


compared to 6% in Q3 last year.


During Q3, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in all regions with revenue up 15% in Asia, up


6% in Europe, and up 16% in the Americas. Our improved revenue growth was driven by the


success of our new products, especially in data acquisition, distributed IO, PXI, and modular


instruments. Our instrument control products, which now only represent 12% of revenue, continued

to show weakness falling by 11% year-over-year and by 4% sequentially. Excluding our instrument


control products, our year-over-year revenue growth would have been 17 percent.


On a year-over-year basis, the acquisitions of Electronic Workbench and of Measurement


Computing net of the divestiture of our German systems integration business added 3.9 million in


revenue in Q3.


Moving down the income statement, gross margins in Q3 were 73.2% up from 72.7% in Q3 last


year. Gross margins were down from 73.9% in Q2. The primary reason for this decline was the


negative sequential impact of the weakness of the euro, which we discussed in our last call. This


reduced our gross margins by 50 basis points sequentially. Included in cost of goods sold is the


amortization of $500,000 of intangibles related to acquisitions.


Total expenses dropped from 65% of revenue in Q3 2004 to 60% this quarter. Our R&D expenses


were $21 million, down by 4% from Q3 2004. In Q3, we capitalized $4.4 million of internally


developed software costs, up from 800,000 in Q3 2004. We expect the level of capitalization to


drop significantly in Q4 as a result of the release of LabVIEW 8 in October.


Amortization to cost of goods sold or previously capitalized software development costs was 1.8


million in Q3. Sales and marketing expenses were $53 million in Q3 up 14% from Q3 last year.


G&A expenses were $11.4 million, up 10% year-over-year. Patent litigation expenses were down


from $2.6 million in Q3 2004 to 125,000 in Q3 2005. Our GAAP operating income increased by


83% year-over-year and represent 13% of revenue compared to 8% in Q3 last year.


Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was down $1.3 million sequentially and accounts


receivable were down $500,000. Net cash and short-term investments were $181 million, up $24


million from June 30th. Headcount as of September 30 was 3707, up 75 from June 30.


During the quarter the company paid $4 million in dividend and on October 21st, the Board of


Directors declared a cash dividend of 5 cents per common share payable November 28, 2005 to


shareholders of record on November 7th.


Now, looking out to Q4, although the J. P. Morgan’s Global Purchasing Managers Index showed


some improvement in September, we remain concerned by the economic environment with rising


interest rates of higher oil prices, and with US industrial production in September suffering its


largest drop in 23 years, we remain cautious. Given our historical seasonal pattern, we are


expecting record revenue in Q4 of between $152 million and $157 million, which equates to the


year-over-year revenue growth rate of between 11% and 15% for the quarter. In Q4, we expect to


report fully diluted earnings per share of between 20 and 24 cents per share.


As these are forward-looking statements, I must caution you that actual revenue and earnings in


Q4 could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as any decline in the global economy,


delays in new product releases, manufacturing inefficiencies, expands overruns, and inventory and


foreign exchange fluctuations.


So, in summary, Q3 was a good quarter with improved revenue and good earnings growth. For the


rest of the year and into 2006, we will be focused on continuing to grow the top line while managing


the growth in our expenses to continue to generate operating leverage. I will be presenting at the


Bear Stearns Conference in New York on November 8th and I hope to see you there.


With that, I will turn it over to Tim Dehne, Senior Vice President of R&D.
