Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CTG Fourth Quarter


Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a


question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as


a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Jim


Culligan, Investor Relations for CTG. Please go ahead.


James M. Culligan, Director of Investor Relations


Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your


interest in CTG. On the call today we have CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt and Brendan


Harrington Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.


Jim and Brendan are going to review the results for the fourth quarter of 2010 and then update you


on the company’s strategy and outlook. We will follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t


have the news release discussing our financial results, you can access it at the company’s website


at ctg.com.


Before we begin, I wanted to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements.


It’s important to note that the company’s actual results could differ materially from those projected.


Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the


forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings release as well in the company’s SEC


filings. You can find these at our website or at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Please review


our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.


And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion.


James R. Boldt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Jim and good morning everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this


morning for our fourth quarter earnings conference call. As you saw in our earnings release in the


fourth quarter of 2010, we exceeded the upper-end of our guidance for both revenue and earnings


per share. For the full year, we returned a double-digit growth with revenue increasing 20% and


EPS up 37% over 2009.


Our revenue and earnings continue to grow as demand for our services expands both as the result


of the continued need in the United States for staffing services and as the healthcare industry


invests in electronic medical records. We expect that as the result of this, demand will continue to


grow at a double-digit pace in 2011.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the 2011 first quarter and the full year,


but first I’m going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial statements. Brendan.


Brendan M. Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Jim. Good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2010, CTG’s revenue grew to $87.3


million, an increase of $19.7 million or 29% from the fourth quarter of 2009.

On a sequential basis, revenue increased 3.4% compared with 2010 third quarter. Solutions


revenues revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $31.2 million, $9.1 million or 41% higher than


last year’s fourth quarter, driven mainly from an increasing level of electronic medical record work in


2010.


As a percentage of total revenue, solutions revenue was 36%, an increase from 33% a year ago


and also up from 34% in the 2010 third quarter. Driven by a continue demand in the quarter,


staffing revenue increased $10.6 million or 23% to $56.1 million. Fourth quarter revenue from IBM,


our largest customer, was $26.9 million, an increase of 51% or $9.1 million compared with last


year’s fourth quarter. As a percent of total revenue, IBM increased to 30.8% in the 2010 fourth


quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2009, revenue from IBM was 26.3% of total revenue.


Revenue from our European operations was $15.9 million, up 4.7% from the $15.2 million recorded


in last year’s fourth quarter. Although the recovery in the European economy continues to lag that


of the US, excluding the foreign exchange fluctuations, the European revenue in the quarter would


have increased 13.3% from last year. The effect of the fluctuations in the US dollar during the fourth


quarter of 2010 decreased our consolidated revenue by approximately $1.3 million or 1.5%.


Direct costs as a percentage of revenue were 78.1% in the fourth quarter compared with 77.8% in


the fourth quarter of 2009 and 79.5% in the trailing third quarter of 2010. Our overall SG&A cost as


a percentage of revenue decreased to 17.1% from 18.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and


increased from 16.8% in the third quarter of 2010.


The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the additional operating leverage from the higher


revenues. Fourth quarter operating income was $4.2 million, up $1.7 million or 65% year-over-year.


Compared with the trailing third quarter, our fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.1


million or 36%.


Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 4.9%, up 110 basis points from the 3.8% in the fourth


quarter of 2009 and up from 3.7% in the trailing third quarter 2010, due to leverage associated with


the higher revenue level and a continued shift toward more profitable solutions business.


Net income increased $1 million to $2.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 63%. On a per diluted


share basis, net income was $0.16 for the quarter, a 60% increase from the 2009 fourth quarter


and a 23% increase from the 2010 third quarter. The 2010 fourth quarter results include equity


compensation expense of approximately $0.01 per diluted share net of tax, while the 2009 fourth


quarter results included approximately $0.02 per diluted share net of tax.


The tax rate for the 2010 fourth quarter was 37.3% compared with 36.5% in the 2009 fourth


quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the company realized a tax benefit as a result of the US


Federal Government’s extension of the research and development credit, which resulted in lower-


than-expected income tax of approximately $140,000 or $0.01 per diluted share.


The income tax rate for the full year 2010 was 39.2%. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2011


to be between 38% and 40%. We had approximately 3,400 employees at the end of the fourth


quarter 2010, of which, 90% were billable resources. We did add approximately 70 new employees


to our head count during the fourth quarter 2010, but the ending head count numbers for both the


third and the fourth quarters of 2010 rounded to 3,400.


On the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding was 60 days at the end of 2010, compared with


the same 60 days at the end of 2009. Our cash generated from operations in the fourth quarter of


2010 was $6.6 million, as compared with cash generated from operations of approximately $0.3


million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 ended in the middle


of a biweekly payroll period for our US operations.
