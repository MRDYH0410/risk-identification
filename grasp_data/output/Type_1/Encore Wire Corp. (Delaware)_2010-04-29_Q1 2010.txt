MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello and welcome to the Encore Wire First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a


reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&A session at the end of the


call. [Operator Instructions]


At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, President and CEO.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Russ. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and CEO of Encore Wire and


with me this morning is Frank Bilban, our CFO.


Unit volume decreases caused by the drop in construction activity continue to create turmoil in our


industry. During the quarter, a competitor exited the market by selling out to another competitor.


Despite the continued volume decreases, there were positive developments, including the increase


in spreads during the past quarter. The spread between the price of wire sold and the cost of raw


copper is a key metric in this industry and a key driver of the level of profitability. With our low cost


structure, the strong upside leverage from the spreads expands.


On a sequential quarter basis, the average cost of copper purchase increased by 10.7%, while the


average cost of wire sold increased by 14.1%, increasing the spread by 28.6%. Our pre-tax loss of


4.1 million, which is 2.5 million net of income taxes, includes a one-time pre-tax charge of 2.6


million, 1.7 million net of income taxes associated with the debt retirement we executed in January.


This positive change in sequential quarterly earnings occurred despite the 13.3% decrease in unit


volumes sold.


We produced these results in this difficult environment due to our low cost business model and


aggressive cost cutting in all facets of our operation. We believe our superior order fill rates


continue to enhance our competitive position, as our electrical distributor customers are holding


lean inventories in the field. The low inventory levels in the distribution chain make Encore’s


excellent order fill rates valuable to customers who are gravitating toward a just-in-time inventory.


We believe our volume decreases are less than total industry. We believe we are able to get a


slight premium for our excellent service level from customers who realize they’re saving money by


buying from us. Despite our desire and effort to be better, our performance is impressive in this


economy, and we thank our employees and associates for their tremendous efforts. We also thank


our shareholders for their continued support.


Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer, will now discuss our financial results. Frank?


Frank Bilban, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute, we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a


copy of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. The release is available on the


Internet or you can call Denise List at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in these initial comments and in the question-


and-answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements

involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more


detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this conference call to the


most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including


EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information for investors, are posted on


www.encorewire.com.


Now for the financial results. Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 were 175.2 million,


compared to 144.5 million during the first quarter of 2009. Net loss for the first quarter of 2010 was


2.5 million versus net income of 4.6 million in the first quarter of 2009.


Fully diluted, excuse me, fully diluted net loss per common share was $0.11 in the first quarter of


2010 versus earnings of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2009. Unit volumes, measured in pounds of


copper contained in the wires sold, during the period declined 30.6% in the first quarter of 2010


versus the first quarter of 2009. However, the spread between the cost of a pound of copper


purchased and the price of a pound of copper sold increased by 12.3%. The 2010 first quarter


results also include a $2.6 million pre-tax charge associated with the early retirement of long-term


debt that the company paid off in January.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $175.2 million


versus $177.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. Net loss for the first quarter of 2010 was


$2.5 million versus a $1.9 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fully diluted net loss per


common share was $0.11 in the first quarter of 2010 versus a $0.08 net loss in the fourth quarter of


2009. Unit volumes declined 13.3% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the fourth quarter of 2009.


However, the spread between the cost of a pound of copper purchased and the price of a pound of


copper sold increased by 28.6%.


We continue to maintain our strong balance sheet. We paid up our long-term debts and our 150


million revolving line of credit has a zero balance. In addition, we had $130.4 million in cash as of


March 31, 2010. Our bank covenants were amended in the quarter to take current economic


conditions into account. We also declared our 14th consecutive quarterly cash dividend during the


first quarter of 2010.


We want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion


of this session. If you wish to hear the taped replay, please call 866-206-0173 and enter the


conference reference number 253426 and the pound sign.


I’ll now turn the floor back over to Daniel Jones, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Daniel?


Daniel Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Frank. Russ, we’re now ready for the questions and answer session.
