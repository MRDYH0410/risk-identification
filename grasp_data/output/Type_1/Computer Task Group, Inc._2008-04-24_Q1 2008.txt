MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CTG conference call.


[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Culligan. Please go


ahead, sir.


Company Representative


Thank you, Gloria, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your


interest in CTG. On the call today we have President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt and


Brendan Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Brendan are going


to review the results for the first quarter 2008 and update you on the company’s strategy and


outlook. They’ll follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing


our financial results, you can access it at the company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected. Additional information concerning factors that could cause


actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings


release, as well as in the company’s SEC filings. You can find them at our website or the SEC’s


website at www.sec.gov.


So please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion.


James R. Boldt, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this


morning for our first quarter earnings conference call. As you saw in our earnings release, our first


quarter revenue and earnings were both above our guidance. We’re excited about the fact that our


new solutions offerings to the healthcare industry were the largest contributor to our better than


expected results in the first quarter. Our favorable outlook for those solutions has caused us to


raise our guidance for the entire year.


I’m going to talk more about our expectations and business in a minute. But first I’m going to ask


Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Jim. Good morning. For the first quarter of 2008, CTG’s revenue was 86.7 million, an


increase of approximately 6.7 million or 8.3% compared with the first quarter of 2007. Net income


was 1.4 million in the first quarter 2008, an increase by 25% from 1.1 million in the first quarter of


2007. Net income per diluted share was $0.09 for the quarter. These results include $147,000 net


of tax or $0.01 per diluted share that CTG recorded for advisory fees incurred with connection with


our consideration of two unsolicited merger proposals from RCM Technologies, Inc. As mentioned


in the release, our Board unanimously rejected both proposals. We do not expect to record any


additional advisory fees associated with these proposals.


Net income for the first quarter 2007 includes a gain of approximately $0.02 per share resulting


from the sale of marketable securities. Excluding the cost of the advisory fees in the first quarter of

2008 and the gain from the sale of marketable securities in the first quarter of 2007, net income


would have more than doubled in the first quarter of 2008.


Excluding the merger evaluation fees from our first quarter results, operating income was 2.6


million, 105% higher than the 2007 first quarter. Net income excluding these fees was 1.6 million or


$0.10 per diluted share. Both the 2008 and 2007 first quarter results include equity compensation


expense of approximately $0.01 per diluted share, net of tax.


Solutions revenue in the first quarter 2008 was 34% of total revenues or 29.5 million. This


represents 9% growth in our solutions revenue compared to the first quarter of 2007. Direct costs


as a percentage of revenue were 78.4% in the quarter compared with 78.2% in the first quarter of


2007 and 77.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007.


We had 27.3 million in revenue from IBM, our largest staffing customer in the first quarter of 2008,


compared with 22.8 million in the first quarter of 2007. This represents 31.4% and 28.5% of total


revenue in the 2008 and 2007 first quarters, respectively.


Quarterly revenue from our European operations was 19 million in the first quarter, a 10% increase


from the 17.3 million recorded in last year’s first quarter. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuation,


European revenue in the quarter would have decreased by 2.6%.


The tax rate for the 2008 first quarter was approximately 40%. The expected tax rate for 2008 is


between 38 and 41%. The company had 3,400 employees at the end of the first quarter 2008, of


which approximately 89% are billable resources.


On the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding was 60 days compared with 62 days at the end of


first quarter 2007 and to 58 days at December 2007. Our cash used in operations in the first quarter


was approximately 329,000. We had 974,000 in capital expenditures and recorded depreciation


expense of 523,000 in the quarter.


During the first quarter of 2008, while adhering to SEC imposed volume limitations, we repurchased


331,000 shares of CTG common stock. The repurchases in the quarter were made at an average


price of $4.42 per share. During this most recent self-imposed blackout period prior to releasing


earnings, we repurchased shares under our 10b5-1 Plan. We intend to continue our repurchase


program throughout 2008. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Brendan. Well as expected, demand for staffing was weak from the US financial services


industry in the first quarter of 2008. Demand from other industries for staffing was stronger than we


had anticipated. When this stronger demand combined with the additional revenue we generated in


taking over the staffing responsibility for a new area at an existing customer site, our staffing


business had a better first quarter than we had anticipated.


As to our solutions business, overall revenue growth was 9% in the first quarter 2008. We’re


clearing beginning to realize the benefits from the investments we made in our solutions business


over the last several years. Most of those investments were in our healthcare business where we


expanded offerings, added sales territories, and hired more sales staff to capitalize on the many


opportunities in the healthcare market. Several new healthcare projects began in the first quarter of


2008 and several more healthcare projects are starting up in the second quarter of this year. As our


proposal activity in our healthcare vertical continues to be robust, it is likely that we will see


additional healthcare business come on line as the year progresses.
