Thank you, Arden, and a good evening to everyone. I would like to discuss some key events during this quarter. The momentum of recovery in Industrial Automation continued in this quarter as we recorded 27.6% and 18.9% year-on-year growth in revenue and new contract, respectively, with revenue achieving year-on-year growth for three consecutive quarters.

Our performance in power industry remained stable and dominant as we signed contracts on Datang Dongying 2X1000MW power units and Guohua Yongzhou 2X1000MW power units, et cetera . In chemical, we signed several major contracts, including a DCS contract with Inner Mongolia FuFeng Group on Biology ingredients workshop project and a contract with Zhonganlianhe Coal-chemical Company on 1.7 million ton methyl alcohol and olefin conversion project. In food beverage area, we signed a contract with Xinjiang Kashi Aodu Sugar Industry on 20 million tons/year Beet Sugar DCS project. In nuclear, we continued to provide products for Tianwan #5 and #6 units.

In factory automation, we kept focusing on several key industries and renowned players and our demonstration-for-further-application approach has been going smoothly. As we perform these projects, we improve our capability of providing turnkey solutions, accumulate track records and raise brand awareness. In white-goods area, our cooperation with Haier went further as we won new contracts on their Tianjin-based and Qingdao-based washing machine factories. Additionally, breakthrough was achieved in new energy area, as we won contracts from Do-Fluoride Chemicals Corporation Limited. to help improve the interconnection, data collection and management of production equipment in their lithium battery workshop. We believe that these projects will lead to more business opportunities from the current and an increasingly wider customer base.

In high speed rail, we signed contract to provide TCC to Longchuan-Shanwei Railway. Our short term performance can be affected by factors such as limited completion of newly planned railway infrastructure in the early years of the 13th five-year-plan and the change in customer procurement timeline. However, we believe that outlook for rail business in the long run remains positive, given an explicit national plan, growing after-sale service demand and launching of our new products. For subway, we adhered to the expansion strategy to win new SCADA contracts in more cities and work closely with subway authorities to promote our SCADA system and subway signaling technologies in future.

In mechanical and electrical installation services, with macroeconomic and political circumstances in South East Asia and Middle East being closely followed, Concord and Bond remained active in exploration and kept executing projects covering various industries. Management and risk control have also been addressed to improve operation efficiency. The strategic value of Concord and Bond as customer resources and international sales channels remains significant and we expect a moderate growth in the future.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Arden Xia who will read the financial results analysis on behalf of CFO, Ms. Herriet Qu.

Thank you, Mr. Shao. I want to share some highlights for the fiscal year 2018 first quarter ended September 30, 2017.

The gross margin fluctuation was mainly due to the different revenue mix with different margin. The GAAP overall gross margin, which includes non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles was 36.4% for the first quarter, as compared to 29.5% for the same period of the prior year.

The GAAP gross margin for integrated contracts, product sales, and services rendered were 29.1%, 71.8% and 71.6% for the first quarter, as compared to 24.9%, 70.5%, and 69.7% for the same period of prior year, respectively.

At this time, we'd like to open up for Q&A session. Please note, that for Chinese speaking participants, we can also do Q&A in Mandarin and we'll provide a translation. Operator, please.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Luo with Morgan Stanley.

Hi.

Hi.

[Foreign Language] (00:19:40-00:21:23)

Okay. The first question is now this quarter the Industrial Automation compare increased, but from the revenue or especially from the new function, but the Rail Transportation compared not too much. So, this quarter the need – from the railway transportation that part the new contracts [indiscernible] (00:21:51) what kind of effect and also we hear about 175 unused trains will be in the [indiscernible] (00:22:02) for the 300 held out when we can sign the contract. This is the first question.

The second one is about the international business. What about the net income support for the whole group. And also about the – for this fiscal year the potential performance to increase what kind of percentage and also talk about the strategy for this area for the coming years.

[Foreign Language] (00:22:36-00:24:23)

And the railway transportation new contract for this quarter compared not too much, but it's mainly coming from the after sale contract like the [ph] subways (00:24:37). And you said about 175 trains for the procurement top line and we will participate bidding actually we have won some part of the trains, but we have not finished the whole signed contract yet, so we cannot disclose exactly numbers, but we will – we believe it will start finish bidding at the end of this calendar year and we will disclose it later. And also the [ph] coupling (00:25:10) factor, we've also recently win some contracts, we will disclose later.

The second question for the comp, for the [indiscernible] (00:25:18) factor international business, we ask the board how product sale, the [indiscernible] (00:25:26) factor especially come from that fiscal year. We – it added some cost for some specific projects, so lead to the goodwill impairment, and also the net income gross margin in our performance very good. And right now, we are focusing on this area to control improvement of the management still and also the product, and because their projects [indiscernible] (00:25:52) Eastern Asia and Middle East, so those areas either did not make or political sector they have some potential challenges.

So we are focusing on the control of the risk, rather than to gain revenue and contract. So this is why its performance not compare increase, but this part that we are striving to improve [indiscernible] (00:26:21) performance and it's still under the control. We think it will gradually peak positive in future. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:26:33-00:27:00)

[Foreign Language] (00:27:03-00:27:21)

And the question...

[Foreign Language] (00:27:24)

[Foreign Language] (00:27:28)

The question is now to the future landscape about the C3 300 kilometer per hour segment and there are three players, how [indiscernible] (00:27:39) market share and also the price. And the answer is about – from the historical record that we could HollySys hold around 30% of the market share, so this will continue but not based on each contract, is based on yearly total average trains procurement. And also the price is very stable, within the gross margin, the trains, the CRC [indiscernible] (00:28:11) to three of us right now. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:28:18)

Operator, next one.

We'll go next to Gary Cheung with Haitong international.

[Foreign Language] (00:28:30-00:28:48)

The question is about the gross margin. If we compare increase and improved a lot, so can we talk about the gross margin future trend?

[Foreign Language] (00:29:04-00:29:17)

Okay. The gross margin is 36% compared increase. So, the specific background, I'll let Mr. Arden Xia to introduce. And from this aspect actually, the percentage of the structure are different than before. And right now, if you see the after sale revenue if you compare, increased a lot, this quarter is around the 17% after sale revenue – of total revenue from the after sale, and this part of margin is higher than average. So that's why for this quarter, the gross margin is better than the last quarter, I mean, the same period of last year.

But, right now, we want to emphasize the future [indiscernible] (00:30:09) is still challenged, because right now for example, the Industrial Automation gross margin is slowing down, because we strategically focusing on penetration the significant contract. So, we will balance the gross margin, try our best to between the range of 35% to 40% as what we've had before. Thank you.

Xie xie.

[Operator Instructions]

Okay. Thank you everyone. It's look like a no further questions. I think this quarter performance just like what we've said before, and for the coming quarters, we believe it will turns better. Okay, next one, Alex maybe...

We'll go next to Alex Chang with Citigroup.

[Foreign Language] (00:31:27).

Hi, Alex.

[Foreign Language] (00:31:33-00:32:12)?

Alex, [Foreign Language] (00:32:16-00:32:20)

[Foreign Language] (00:32:19-00:32:39)?

The first question is about the exchange loss and also the cost in that piece, what about – to Japan, I think you explained, what about the items? And the second question is about the expenditure is increasing and to compare, revenue a little bit higher ratio than the revenue increase. So, what about whole fiscal year expenditure trend?

[Foreign Language] (00:33:12-00:34:43)

The first question about the exchange loss, and this part now effect too much, because we are – is related import and export of our house products, right now take a very small percentage. And from the whole, the whole transport – the whole financial before the translation it always meet the [indiscernible] (00:35:09), but right now you have talked about the exchange loss this quarter, will not too much in future.

And the second one about the [indiscernible] (00:35:21), actually that this is also compared to equity investee, the equity investee and the cost investee are related partially upholding of the company, less than 50%. If between 30% to 50%, it will booking into the equity investee and if between 20% to 30% of the shares, it will be booking into the cost investee, so this is the item differences.

And the second question about the expenditure is growing and [indiscernible] (00:36:03) the trend is growing right now because we create more SG&A like the selling activities, those kind of things. But from absolute value to see in recent years, around $85 million you could see and this year from absolute value it's just a little bit maybe 10% increase around, but that's still not too much. Thank you.

Xie xie.

Xie xie, Alex. Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today.

Thanks, Arden.

We have another one, sorry.

We'll go next. And we have no further questions. Thank you.

Okay. Operator. We can go to the next one, for last one more question.

We'll go next to [indiscernible] (00:37:15).

Hi, thank you. Arden, a quick question for Mr. Shao. Could you please explain the CapEx budget for this new year and also, I understand that there should have been a board vote regarding the dividend – the regular dividend. Could you inform us the result of that vote and also what the payout ratio is? Thank you.

Okay. [Foreign Language] (00:37:50-00:38:09)

[Foreign Language] (00:38:11-00:38:26)

Okay. I'll do the translation, the CapEx each year not so much we're close to couple of companies, so you could see no more than $10 million each year. And second question about dividend, dividend we have a regular dividend policy, the payout ratio is 10%, and last year we changed that policy to a regular dividend policy.

So, just to follow-up, the payout ratio is going to remain unchanged at 10%, because that seems to be a very low payout ratio relative to the CapEx needs and also to the cash flow you're generating on an annual basis. So, I'm just curious why we are keeping the payout ratio so low, when the company is brimming with cash?

Okay. [Foreign Language] (00:39:22-00:39:34)

[Foreign Language] (00:39:35-00:40:17)

From recent years, because in China it's [indiscernible] (00:40:19) automation. So you can see our business focusing on the IA, especially Industrial Automation and also international business expansion and that's why we more like to put the resources into this area to keep the pace with the market in recent years, but from the long-term we definitely will consider to raise the payout ratio. Thank you, [ph] Peter (00:40:45).

And we'll go next to Kevin Luo with Morgan Stanley.

[Foreign Language] (00:40:58-00:42:16)

The first question is now that [indiscernible] (00:42:19) a new contract, we heard from the market that [indiscernible] (00:42:23) how about the contract that carry to these little bit information. The second question is about the subway signaling control system, because right now the market that you could see it will lead, it has been lead by the local government and also some construction companies. So even through that PBT model, what about to your method currently, maybe participate PBT or cooperate with the local government, that would be better to penetrate the signaling control system.

[Foreign Language] (00:43:05-00:44:35)

Okay. The first question is about the [indiscernible] (00:44:37), we separate by two parts, one is regular speed license and second one is high-speed rail license, about 300. Right now, we just get regular speed license and we won a contract, it's called [ph] Shenyang (00:44:53) Line, but the contract size is not very sizable, it's just less than CNY 10 million, because currently the regular speed [indiscernible] (00:45:07) compared high-speed rail [indiscernible] (00:45:10) have just a few contract, but in the high-speed rail [indiscernible] (00:45:18), we already got the [indiscernible] (00:45:20) in line and for running at least one year. So we will probably get the license in the fiscal year 2019 calendar year. And by the way, the [indiscernible] (00:45:36) Line when we win the contract it will be finished, the whole contract will recognize revenue within this fiscal year.

And the second question about PBT project and subway signaling, we are participating at bidding and hopefully, we can get the subway signaling within one year, and the PBT project because we really need to do it very cautiously. It depends on the PBT model, the project itself, because sometimes it's not just limited responsibility, its unlimited responsibility and also put a lot of money. We can't just do what we can afford. And it depends on the profit of the project and also depend on the risk control. We have not deny to do PBT project, and we are also under discussion with local governments right now.

Xie xie, Kevin. Thank you Kevin.

Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise the questions, we'll pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We look forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.

Thank you.

That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participating. You may now all disconnect.
