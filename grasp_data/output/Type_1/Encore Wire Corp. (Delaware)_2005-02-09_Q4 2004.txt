MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning thank you for joining Encore Wire's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference


Call. As a reminder all lines will be on listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&A session at the


end of the call.


At this time it is my pleasure to present Mr. Daniel Jones, President, of Encore Wire, Mr. Jones?


Daniel Jones, President, Chief Operating Officer


Yes Ma'am, thank you very much. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Encore


Wire Corporation's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm Daniel Jones, the President and Chief


Operating Officer of Encore Wire. And with me this morning are Vincent Rego, the Chairman of


The Board, and Frank Bilban our Chief Financial Officer.


Our branch ran very efficiently during the quarter keeping costs low while we adjusted our


production schedules. The recent capital expenditures we have made in our plants have enhanced


our manufacturing flexibility to produce our products. We are adjusting inventory levels to take


advantage of that flexibility.


Our general, administrative costs remain extremely low and we continue to focus on tight cost


controls throughout our operation. We are also pleased to report another strong quarter while we


continue to strive to improve margins in any way possible.


We've grown sales and earnings dramatically during the past year and we continue to resist gaining


volume by cutting process and are focusing our customer's attention on innovative products and


superior order-fill rates.


Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer will now discuss our financial results, Frank?


Frank Bilban, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President-Finance, Treasurer


Thank you Daniel. In a minute I will review Encore's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2004.


After the financial review we will take any questions you may have.


Each of you should have received a copy of Encore's press release covering Encore's financial


results. This release is available on the Internet, or you can call Doris Easterlund [ph], or me, at


800-962-9473 and we'll get you a copy.


Before we begin let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question-and-answer


session that follows we may make certain statements that might be considered to be forward


looking. In order to comply with certain Securities Legislation and instead of attempting to identify


each particular statement as forward looking, we advise you that all such statements involve certain


risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed


today. I refer each of you to the company's SEC Reports and news releases for a more detailed


discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Now for the financial results. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 20% to $147.5


million from $123.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Sales dollars increased due to higher


prices per pound of product shipped in 2004 versus 2003. The higher sales prices were due


primarily to the higher cost of copper in 2004.

quarter of 2003. Fully diluted, net income per share was 27 cents in the fourth quarter of 2004


compared to 30 cents in the same period of 2003. All net income per share, and fully diluted net


income per share amounts, in this communication, have been restated to reflect the effect of the


company's 3 for 2 stock split which was paid as a stock dividend in August 2004.


For the year ended December 31, 2004 net sales increased 57% to $603.2 million versus $384.8

cents per share in 2004 compared to net income per share of 63 cents in 2003. The sales dollars,


unit volume, and earnings amounts are all records for the company.


Our EBITDA or earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2004 was $66.3


million; an increase of 77% over the $37.5 million in 2003. Our outstanding debt balance


decreased by $19.2 million in the quarter. Our strong cash flow enabled us to pay down the debt


as well as funding $5.2 million in additional capital expenditures during the quarter. Our debt


balance remains conservative and our interest costs is low. We also want everyone to know that


this conference call will be available through E-play after the conclusion of this session. Anyone


wishing to hear this tape replayed, should call 866-206-0194 and enter the conference reference


number 150619. I will now turn the floor over to Daniel Jones, our President and COO; and Mr.


Vincent Rego, our Chairman and CEO. Daniel?


Daniel Jones, President and COO


Thank you. As Frank highlighted, our annual sales dollars unit sales and earnings set new records.


The environment in our industry is still highly competitive and resulted in lower margins, comp


processes [ph] had been fairly volatile although trending upward which translated into process


volatility in the building wire market and margin erosion. We believe we're well positioned for future


growth. Our balance sheet is strong and our cells are growing. Mr. Rego, do you have any


comments? Lisa, we're ready for the Q&A session.
