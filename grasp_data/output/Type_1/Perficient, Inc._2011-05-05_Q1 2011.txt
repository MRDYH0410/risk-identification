MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Perficient Inc.


Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie, and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time,


all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the


end of today’s call. [Operator Instructions]


I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Jeff Davis, CEO and


President. Please proceed.


Jeffrey S. Davis, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thank you very much. This is Jeff Davis. With me on the call this morning is, Paul Martin, our CFO.


I’d like to thank you all for your time this morning. As is typical, we’ve got about 10 to 15 minutes of


prepared comments, after which we’ll open the call for questions.


Paul, would you please read the Safe Harbor statement?


Paul E. Martin, Chief Financial Officer


Sure. Good morning, everyone. Some of the things we will discuss in today’s call concerning future


company performance will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws.


Actual results may materially differ from those discussed in these forward-looking statements and


we encourage you to refer to the additional information contained in our SEC filings concerning


factors that could cause those results to be different than contemplated in today’s discussion.


In addition, our earnings press release, including a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial


measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with


Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, is posted on our website at


www.perficient.com under News and Events. We have also posted a reconciliation of certain non-


GAAP goals to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with


GAAP on our website at www.perficient.com under Investor Relations. Jeff?


Jeffrey S. Davis, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Paul. Well again thank you everyone for joining. Pleased to be with you today to share our


Q1 results. 2011 started well for Perficient, we delivered revenues within our previously issued


guidance range, and actually slightly above the mid-point of the services guidance range.


Total revenues were up 15% year-over-year and services revenues were up 18% year-over-year.


Strong average bill rates resulted in higher gross margins and we posted GAAP earnings per share


and net income that were up 100% over a year ago.


Utilization was consistent with Q4 at 79% in total, but that was due specifically to lower utilization of


resources in China, where we’re investing for growth through the recent addition of about 40


interns. Excluding some contractors in China, utilization actually rose from 79% to 82% in the


quarter.


I mentioned ABR, which for U.S. employees was $123 an hour, the highest it’s been for quite


sometime. That’s evidence to us of a recovery market. As we’ve talked about in previous calls, we


believe we still have room for incremental improvement to ABR as the year unfolds, as well as

down the road. I think this can be a $135 an hour business within a couple of years, so long as the


macro-environment remains stable.


From a bookings perspective, we closed 22 deals north of $500,000 during the quarter, which is


more than any quarter during 2010. We mentioned on the year end call that clients have been more


willing in late 2010 to commit to projects before year end than they were in 2009. So Q4 bookings


were strong and so it was great to see that momentum continue in Q1.


And in fact, our bookings for Q1 were again, an increase to our Q4 bookings. And we don’t typically


talk about the number of active accounts or number of active clients we have in terms of disclosing


the specific number, meaning customers that we’re serving in any given quarter. But those


numbers in Q1 were also higher than in any quarter during 2010. That’s a testament to something


we spoke about on the year end call, which is our increasing number of new clients. So, it’s


pleasing to see that we’re adding new customers, which should lead to growth down the road. So,


it’s clear to us that recovery remains underway. And we again exited the quarter with plenty of cash


and no debt.


And notably, while it wasn’t a first quarter transaction, we did announce the acquisition of Exervio


on the first day of the second quarter, so on April 1st. And that transaction expanded our capability


portfolio, added over $13 million of run rate revenues to the business, and built our footprint through


the addition of offices and local presence in Charlotte and Atlanta, two key markets we’ve targeted


for some time.


But finally, as we mentioned in the press release, the Board recently approved our request to


expand the share repurchase program. And we’re raising both our full year revenue and earnings


guidance. I’ll provide a little more color around the results, as well as talk to the guidance raises


after Paul details our Q1 financial performance. Paul?


Paul E. Martin, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Jeff. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2011 were $56.2 million, a 15% increase over


the year ago quarter. Services revenue for the first quarter, excluding reimbursable expenses,


increased 18%, to $50.2 million over the comparable prior year period.


Services gross margin for the first quarter of 2011, excluding stock compensation and reimbursable


expenses, increased to 32.4%, compared to 32% in the first quarter 2010, continuing our trend of


year-over-year margin improvement.


SG&A expenses increased to $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 from $10.4 million in the


comparable prior year quarter. Excluding non-cash stock compensation, SG&A expenses were


$9.7 million, compared to $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2010. SG&A, excluding stock


compensation as a percentage of revenue was 17.3% in the first quarter of 2011, compared to


17.4% in the first quarter of 2010. Stock compensation expense was $1.5 million in the first quarter,


which is down $400,000, compared to the $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2010.


EBITDAS defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock


compensation for the first quarter of 2011 was $7.1 million or 12.6% of revenues, compared to $5.5


million or 11.3% of revenues in the first quarter of 2010. Net income was $1.8 million for the first


quarter of 2011, doubled than $900,000 generated in the first quarter of 2010.


Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $0.06 a share for the first quarter of 2011, from


$0.03 a share for the first quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased to $0.15 per


share for the first quarter of 2011, from $0.12 for the first quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP EPS is


defined as GAAP earnings per share, plus amortization expense, non-cash stock compensation,
