MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today’s First Quarter Earnings


Review Conference Call. Please note that all your lines are on listen-only mode and there will be


time for a Q&A session towards the conclusion of this meeting. [Operator Instructions] And now, to


start off our conference, I’d like to welcome and turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Jones, Chief


Executive Officer, Encore Wire. Go ahead, sir.


Daniel L. Jones, President & Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Myrna. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation quarterly conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive Officer


of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer.


We’re pleased to announce strong quarterly earnings in the midst of a severe recession currently


taking place in the construction industry. As we have repeatedly noted, the key metric to our


earnings is the spread between the average price of wire [audio gap] and the company’s average


cost of raw copper per pound in any given period. That spread increased 42.2% in the first quarter


of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010, while our unit volume shipped in the first quarter of 2011


increased 28.9% versus the first quarter of 2010. The spread increased 14.3% on a sequential-


quarter basis, while unit volume increased 5.3%, driving the increase in our earnings. In the trailing


12 months ended March 31, 2011, we produced net sales of $1.038 billion, a net income of $28.4


million, or $1.22 per share, versus net sales of $680.4 million and a net loss of $3.4 million, or


negative $0.15 per share, in the 12 months ended March 31, 2010.


The results in the last four quarters are particularly encouraging. We believe the exit of a former


competitor in the first quarter of 2010 has contributed to the positive trend in our industry pricing


levels and margins over the last four quarters. We continue to strive to lead or support industry


price increases to achieve profit growth. We believe our superior order fill rates continue to


enhance our competitive position as our electrical distributor customers are holding lean inventories


in the field. As orders come in from electrical contractors, the distributors can count on our order fill


rates to ensure quick deliveries from coast to coast. We’ve been able to accomplish this despite


holding what is historically lean inventory levels for us. We believe our performance is impressive in


this economy and we thank our employees and associates for their tremendous efforts. We also


thank our shareholders for their continued support. Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer, will


now discuss our financial results. Frank?

Frank J. Bilban, CFO, Secretary, Treasurer, CAO & Vice President


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute, we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have already


received the copies of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. This release is


available on the Internet or you can call Tracey West at 800-962-9473, and we’ll get you a copy.


Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question-and-


answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements


involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more


detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this conference call to the


most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including


EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information for investors, are posted on


www.encorewire.com.


Moving along to the financial results, net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 were $303.4


million, compared to $165.2 million during the first quarter of 2010. Net income for the first quarter


of 2011 was $10.7 million, versus a net loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2010. Fully-diluted


net income per common share was $0.46 in the first quarter of 2011 versus a net loss of $0.11 in


the first quarter of 2010.


Unit volumes, measured in pounds of copper contained in the wires sold during the period


increased 28.9% in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010. This spread between


the cost of a pound of copper purchased and the sale price of wire containing a pound of copper


increased by 42.2%.


The 2010 first-quarter results included a $2.6 million pre-tax charge associated with the early


retirement of long-term debt that the company paid off in January of 2010.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the first quarter of 2011 were $303.4 million,


versus $256.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2010. Net income for the first quarter of 2011 was


$10.7 million, versus $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Fully-diluted net income per common


share was $0.46 in the first quarter of 2011, versus $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Unit


volumes increased 5.3% in the first quarter of 2011, versus the fourth quarter of 2010.


The spread between the cost of a pound of copper purchased and the sales price of wire containing


a pound of copper increased by 14.3%. As Daniel previously highlighted, our performance in the


trailing 12-month comparisons are particularly encouraging.


Our balance sheet is very strong. We have no long-term debt and our revolving line of credit is paid


down to zero. In addition, we have $75.2 million in cash as of March 31, 2011. We also declared


another quarterly cash dividend during the last quarter.


We want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion


of this session. If you wish to hear the taped replay, please call 866-551-4520 and enter the


conference reference 272369 and the # sign.


I’ll now turn the floor back over to Daniel Jones, our President and CEO. Daniel?
