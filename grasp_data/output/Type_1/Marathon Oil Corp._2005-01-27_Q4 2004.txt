MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this Marathon Oil Corporation Fourth Quarter and


Full Year Review 2004 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. For opening


remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Matheny, Vice President of


Investor Relations and Public Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.


Kenneth L. Matheny, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Affairs


Okay. Thank you very much, Gwen. I would like to say good afternoon as well and welcome


everybody today to our fourth quarter 2004 earnings teleconference.


With me on the call today from Marathon Oil are Clarence Cazalot, President and CEO, and Janet


Clark, Chief Financial Officer. Also, with me from Marathon Ashland Petroleum are Gary


Heminger, President, and Garry Peiffer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Information


Technology.


I am going to spend about 20 minutes reviewing the fourth quarter results and the full year 2004


and then Clarence Cazalot will spend about 10 minutes summarizing 2004 and outlining our 2005


plans, then we will open the call to questions. Approximately 2 hours after this call ends, these


remarks will be placed on the ‘Investor Relations’ portion of our website where they will remain for


one year.


I need to caution everybody that my remarks today will contain certain forward-looking statements


that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from


those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with the Safe Harbor provisions of


the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its


annual on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2003 and in subsequent Forms 10-Q and


8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors but not necessarily all factors that could


cause feature outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.


Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $429 million or a $1.23 per share. Reported net


income included after tax special items totaling a positive $14 million. These items included a $65


million mark-to-market gain on two UK long term gas contracts, a $34 million impairment loss


related to our Russian properties, and a $17 million expense related to insurance obligations.


Net income adjusted for these special items was $415 million, a $1.19 per share and that was $119


higher than the third quarter adjusted net income of $296 million, primarily because of higher


upstream production combined with higher crude oil and natural gas prices. Reported net income


for the full year 2004 was $1.261 billion or $3.73 per share compared to $1.321 billion or $4.26 per


share in 2003. For the full year 2004, adjusted net income totaled $1.369 billion, that’s $4.05 per


share excluding a negative $108 million of after-tax special items. This compares with 2003’s level


of $1.073 billion or $3.45 per share excluding net positive after-tax special items of $248 million.


The $296 million increase in adjusted net income was primarily attributable to higher liquid and


natural gas prices in the upstream segment partially offset by lower production volumes and


significantly higher refining and wholesale margins and higher refinery runs in the downstream


segment. In fact this was the second best financial performance by MAP in its 7 year history.


A reconciliation of net income adjusted for special items to net income, including an explanation of


the reasons for using this non-GAAP measure is included in our third and fourth quarter 2004


earnings press releases. These press releases are posted on our website under Press Releases,

which is located under the News Center tab. Unless otherwise stated, comparisons made in this


conference call are to results from the third quarter 2004.


Looking at the upstream segment, fourth quarter operating income of $443 million was $92 million


higher than the third quarter mainly as a result of higher production volumes, higher oil and gas


realizations, lower derivative losses and $34 million of business interruption and insurance


recoveries related to Petronius in the Gulf of Mexico. These were partially offset by higher


exploration expense, higher DD&A, and higher production taxes and an accrual of $11 million for


hurricane damages to the Petronius platform in the Gulf of Mexico.


For all of 2004 upstream operating income was $1.69 billion or 13.76 per BOE that’s $116 million


more than the 2003 level of 1.580 billion or $11.59 per BOE and that number excludes discontinued


operations. Higher income in 2004 was primarily due to higher realizations partially offset by lower


volumes, higher derivative losses, and increased production taxes. Focusing on domestic


upstream operations, fourth quarter operating income was $238 million and that’s $6 million less


than the third quarter primarily a result of lower liquids volumes and higher expiration expense


partially offset by higher gas prices and lower derivative losses and the previously mentioned


insurance recoverage and damage accruals related to Petronius. Our average domestic realized


liquids price, excluding derivative activity, was $34.84 per barrel, that was 72 cents less than the


third quarter level despite an increase in spot WTI of $4.38 per barrel, primarily due to the widening


in the sweet/sour differential during the quarter. Approximately 80% of our domestic crude


production was sour during the fourth quarter and that’s higher than normal, with Petronius still


under repair after Hurricane Ivan.


Our fourth quarter average domestic gas price of $5.09 per MCF, excluding derivative activity, was


up 33 cents from the third quarter. If you look at our lower 48 gas sales, our realized price of $6.35


was 70 cents over third quarter prices, while bid week prices increased by a $1.30. While we sell a


majority of our lower 48 gas at bid week prices, Gulf of Mexico damage from Hurricane Ivan


resulted in lower volumes of this higher value production – that contributed to this


underperformance. DD&A of $5.49 per BOE was slightly higher than the third quarter as a result of


deferred production from Petronius in the Gulf of Mexico.


For the full year 2004, DD&A was $5.33 per BOE, including 18 cents per BOE of asset retirement


obligations. Domestic liquids production in the fourth quarter was 65,000 barrels of liquids per day,


that was down 15,000 barrels of liquids a day from the third quarter, again, primarily related to


hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico.


Domestic gas production averaged 585 million cubic feet a day, again down slightly from the third


quarter because of hurricane damage. In the international upstream segment, income for the fourth


quarter was $205 million, an increase of $98 million over the third quarter, primarily attributable to


higher volumes and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher DD&A, higher production taxes


and higher shipping and handling, all a result of the higher volumes in the quarter.


Our average foreign liquids price of $38.72 per barrel was up $1.65 sequentially and that was less


than the $2.31% increase in Dated Brent, primarily as a result of wider quality and transportation


related differentials in the quarter. Our average international gas price of $3.79 per MCF was up $1


on the strengthening of seasonal European gas prices. DD&A was $7 per barrel of oil equivalent,


excluding the impairment of the Russian producing properties, and that was down 72 cents over the


third quarter, primarily a result of higher liftings from Russia, EG, and Gabon.


For the full year 2004, international DD&A was $6.97 per barrel and that included 51 cents per BOE


of asset retirement obligation. International oil liftings in the fourth quarter were 97,000 barrels of


liquids a day, that was 21,000 barrels per day higher as a result of higher liftings from Foinaven,


Gabon, Russian, and EG. Gas production of 411 cubic feet per day was 108 million cubic per day
