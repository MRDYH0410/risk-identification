MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the eMagin Corporation third quarter


2006 earnings conference call. My name is Rachel and I will be your coordinator for today. At this


time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session


towards the end of today's conference. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the


presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. John Atherly, Chief Financial Officer,


please proceed, sir.


John Atherly, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Rachel. And welcome to eMagin's fiscal year 2006 third quarter earnings conference call.


I'm John Atherly, CFO of eMagin Corporation. I'm here today by Gary Jones – I am joined here


today by Gary Jones, our CEO.


Before we would begin, I would like to remind you all that we will be referring to numbers that are


part of our 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2006, and that during today's call, we will


make forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


These forward-looking statements are based on the company's current expectations, projections,


beliefs and estimates and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Such statements


include, reference projections of future revenues, plans for product development and production,


the company's ability to ramp up production in manufacturing facilities, future contracts and


commercial arrangements, future product benefits, future operations, liquidity and capital resources


as well as statements containing words like believe, expect, estimate, plan, anticipate, target, will,


intend, could, would and other such expressions.


Risk factors are included in the company's Form 10-K reported in 2005 filed with the Securities and


Exchange Commission. Except that it is directly required by the federal securities laws, we


undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a


result of new information, future events, changes in circumstances or any other reason.


To begin, I will summarize our results for the third quarter and then Gary will discuss our recent


annual meeting and other covenants, and we will take questions.


I'm pleased to report that revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006


were both at all-time record levels. For the quarter, revenue was up 103% to 2.3 million as


compared to 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2005 and up 37% sequentially from second quarter


2006 levels. For the nine-month period, revenue grew 127% to 5.6 million, up from 2.5 million in


2005. These figures reflect significantly increased sales of our micro display.


Since our last call, we announced three large contracts consisting of a six-year supply agreements


with Sagem for more than 37,000 micro displays and two government contracts for approximately 2


million. We continue to expect the signing of another large agreement later this quarter that could


be up – worth up to $40 million over the next six years if all options are exercised. It is interesting to


note that the third quarter revenue did not include revenue that we had anticipated from the V3i


modified to G 800 program. They are currently testing customized product modifications. V3i is also


addressing other business issues not directly related to eMagin and have not yet scheduled


delivery. Although Inventory has been set aside to shift to the customers as soon as delivery is


scheduled.


Cost of goods for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was up 9% to 2.9 million as compared to


2.7 million in the year ago period. Gross loss decreased approximately $900,000 to 650,000, down


from 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2005. These improvements resulted from the process

changes implemented during the first quarter coupled together with higher revenues and lower


operating and employee cost. During the quarter, our New York manufacturing facilities churned


out special products to support a doubling of revenue as well as significant additions to finished


goods inventory. Included in 2006 cost-of-goods expenses were $112,000 of non-cash stock


compensation expenses related to FAS 123R option expenses. We did not expense our options in


2005. Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 were 2.8 million, down


$800,000 from the second-quarter levels due to reductions in staff at variable costs. Operating


expenses for the equivalent period in 2005 was 2.2 million. The $600,000 of difference attributable


to FAS 123R charges of approximately $600,000 during the quarter in 2006.


Other expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was $340,000 as compared to other


income of 34,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Other expenses during the quarter


resulted from our placement of approximately $6 million of convertible notes and more because


warrants were included with the debt, approximately $2 million of the investment, it's all going to be


deferred debt discount. That amount has been amortized through interest expense for 18 months


life of the notes. For the quarter just ended, $230,000 of these non-cash expenses were included in


other expenses. Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was 3.8 million or $0.04 per


share, down $1 million from second quarter of 2006 level due to higher revenue and reductions in


headcount variable expenses. Contained in the loss for the quarter in 2006 were non-cash charges


of approximately $930,000 associated with the expensing of stock options and the amortization of


the debt discount just mentioned.


On a non-GAAP basis, excluding those two charges net loss was 2.9 million. Net loss for the


quarter ended September 30, 2005, which also did not include option expenses or amortization of


debt discount was $3.8 million or $0.05 per share. Pending inventory at September 30, 2006 was


2.9 million, down from 3.8 million at December 31, 2005 due to lower headsets and the wafer raw


material levels. The category breakout for September 30 are as follows, raw materials represented


1.4 million, work-in-process 266,000, and finished goods 1.3 million with the inventory mix tilting


toward displays rather than headsets as of 12/31.


Current liabilities increased to 5.3 million at September 30, 2006 as compared to 3.6 million at


December 31, 2005. The increase in liabilities was due to the addition of $3 million associated with


the current portion of our convertible notes of the portions due July 212007. The revenue growth


and greater manufacturing stability that we see today of the results of years of work that are now


becoming evident. This effort puts the company to position to thrive, but it is not sort of easily


measurable milestone related activity that gives people visibility until that influences our income


statement as it started to do this quarter. eMagin technology is an enabler for all applications that


require low power and high-resolution virtual images.


Today, it is military that propelled us along the adoption curve, which was clearly a significant factor


in our decision to stress the military portion of our business, and high insight it is quite clear why the


benefits of our micro displays will lead to success in these markets. However, it is important to


remember that the recent multimillion dollar contracts to thermal imaging won by our OEM's have


the results of work that started with them many years ago, and it is also just a sample of the total


number of projects underway.


The proliferation of video to handheld devices such as the iPod and cellular phones also builds


interest on a daily basis for portable low-power accessories that provide image enlargement. These


areas while potentially quite large are early in their development cycle. Again, because these


marketable efforts are not sort of easily measurable milestone related activities, they give people


visibility, many investors have a hard time understanding how and when are opportunities translate


into positive financial results. To be fair, we realized that some of these impatience came from 2004


and 2005 were revenue was flat at approximately $3.5 million each year. What's changed since


then? It's nice to be able to say our results. Through the first nine months of 2006, revenues was


on-pace to exceed 100% annual growth of more than 2004 and 2005s combined revenue.
