Question And Answer Section

[Abrupt Start]

Okay. Thank you so much. I'll place you into the HollySys' Second Quarter Earnings Call.

On food and beverage area, we have decided to provide the innovative solution to address the safety and efficiency issues. Upon the successful delivery of the first project, our relationship with Hai Di Lao went deeper, with a regular communication mechanism set. We expect a broader cooperation with them and more clients in the future. So, performance of the high-speed rail was prominent in the quarter – in this quarter, with a revenue recording at 199.0% year-on-year growth at $69.6 million.

One of the contributors is the significant increasing in after sales orders, including ATP maintenance and replacement contracts. Signing 80 sets of Automatic Train Protection, ATP to high-speed train in 300 kilometers per hour and 350 kilometers per hour also contributed greatly to the revenue because of the tightening delivery schedule to secure the Spring Festival Travel. Breakthrough has been made in our new product as we signed our first tract circuit contract for Chengdu-Ya'an regular speed railway line. In subway, we signed SCADA contract for Chengdu Subway Line 5. We will adhere to the expansion strategy to win SCADA contracts in more cities and work closer with the subway authorities to promote our SCADA system and subway signaling technology in future. Management teams will adhere to the diversity strategy to create revenue stream from more new products and service, and to maintain a stable and healthy growth into the future.

In oversea business, we signed several EPC contracts with domestic companies, including a contract with Shandong Ludian Corporation Limited to provide DCS for two 350 megawatt power station in Indonesia. Mechanical and electrical installation services recorded at 0.4% revenue growth at $30.2 million. We continued to address operation, management and risk control issue to ensure that projects can be delivered in good quality, while closely following the economic and political circumstances in South East Asia and Middle East. Concord and Bond remained active in seeking business opportunities and we believe that their strategic value as customer resources and international sales channels remains significant.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Arden Xia, who will read the financial results analysis on behalf of CFO, Ms. Herriet Qu.

Thank you, Mr. Shao. I would like to share some highlights for the fiscal year 2018 in the second quarter ended December 31, 2017. Comparing the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, the revenue for the second quarter increased from $99.1 million to $157.4 million, representing a increase of 58.8%. Broken down by the revenue types, service revenue increased by 274.3% to $13.3 million. Product sales revenue increased by 68.4% to $9.7 million and integrated contracts revenue increased by 15% to $134.4 million. The company total revenue presented in segments [indiscernible] (00:05:06), Industrial Automation, $57.6 million; Railway Transportation, $69.6 million; M&E, $30.2 million and total $157.4 million.

The gross margin fluctuation was mainly due to the difference in revenue mix with different margin. The GAAP overall gross margin, which includes non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles was 39.3% for the second quarter as compared to 28.6% for the same period of prior year. The GAAP gross margin for integrated contracts, product sales and services rendered were 34.4%, 67.4%, and 68.6% for the second quarter as compared to 24.2%, 72.1%, and 64.9% for the same period of prior year respectively. Selling expenses were $7.7 million for the second quarter representing an increase of $1.4 million or 22.7% compared to $60.3 million for the same quarter of prior year.

The income tax expenses and effective tax rate were $9.3 million and 20.4% for the second quarter, as compared to $1.6 million at 13.5% for the comparable prior year period. The effective tax rate fluctuation was mainly due to the different pre-tax income mix with different tax rates as the company's apply to different tax rates. The non-GAAP net income attributable to HollySys, which excludes the non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which is calculated based on the numbers of shares or options granted and the fair value as of the grant date, amortization of acquired intangible assets, fair value adjustments of acquisition-related considerations, and the fair value adjustments of our – derivative was $36.3 million or $0.60 per diluted share based on 61.3 million shares outstanding for the second quarter.

At this time, we'd like to open up for the Q&A session. Please note that for Chinese speaking participants we can also do the Q&A in Mandarin and we'll provide translation. Operator, please.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Sky Hong with Deutsche Bank.

[Foreign Language] (00:14:48 – 00:15:15) The first question is about the factory automation. Is there any progress within recent months for the factory automation because we also see from the government side, we asked the first the right person within our standard to establish a new standard for the industry focus on the intelligent.

[Foreign Language] (00:15:42-00:17:55) Okay. We focus on the three [indiscernible] (00:18:02) to do the factory automation. The first is focus on the – cooperate with the large area or industry or cooperate with the companies like Haier or Hai Di Lao. We signed the contract to do the project and they are satisfied with the final results. So we signed further the larger contract than before. And this is by the recognition of different sub-vertical and also recognition by the potential customers. The second one is focused on the inter-intelligence area because we all meet the same situation, the factory automation, the traditional industry want to upgrade. So to focus on the digital and intelligence is the next step. And beyond the cooperate with the customer focused on the products, we also have to raise our solution to focus on the whole area and that's why we provide a [ph] white book (00:19:20). This is also including our own product, new product and new technology to support the potential end markets.

And the third one is to enlarge our brand name within the whole industry within China, especially to participate some activities, especially like to raise the standard also with the central government. We're in the government level recognition as listed one of the 23 intelligent manufacturing systems solution provider recommended by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. And so these activities, what we are doing for the factory automation and we hope it will bring to you the new product and new technology in the coming months.

Thank you.

And we'll go next to Alex Chang with Citi.

[Foreign Language] (00:20:44-00:21:56) Okay. The first question have include manage separate verticals. The first one is for the, can we provide the percentage for the high-speed rail and subway, the proportions for this quarter? And the second vertical is for the after sale revenue for the service contract that we could see are large increase. And this part when recognized revenue is looking into the after sale or looking into the integrated revenue – integrated contract revenue? And the third one is, the proportion of after sale revenue for the high-speed rail right now?

[Foreign Language] (00:22:49-00:23:50) The first question is for the proposal of the high speed rail and the subway revenue. The proposal will be called at the end of this fiscal year. Currently we have no data on hand, but it's probably like 80% – more than 80% from the high-speed rail revenue at the end. And the second is about recognition of the service contract within high-speed rail will copulate into the after sale scale revenue, not integrated contract revenue. And the third one, the after sale proposal for high speed rail we're not disclosing putting out number, we just provided total after sale revenue right now currently by total around the more than 15%. But from another aspect, the high speed rail after sale revenue is increasing very fast from original single-digit of high-speed rail revenue to – right now two digits.

[Foreign Language] (00:24:55-00:25:32) The question is for the replacement is for what kind of level of the repairment [indiscernible] (00:25:39) or what kind [indiscernible] (00:25:42)?

And the answer is, it's not very directly equal to the five level repairment. Actually right now a lot of repairments from the Level 4 and the replacement is not named at the Level 5.

[Foreign Language] (00:26:08-00:26:52) The first question is the [indiscernible] (00:26:57) use for the ATP contract and how many recognized by the, by the end of December 1? And also the second question is about ASP trend for these contracts? And the third question is about the [ph] D2 (00:27:18) area, 200 kilometers, 250 kilometers for our segment, what about the future trend for the procurement?

[Foreign Language] (00:27:34-00:29:35) I corrected the first question, it's not for the recognize how many trains, actually the question is for the 80 set or MUs contract is [ph] calculated or when (00:29:50) by the first half year of 2017 or the second half year 2017. The answer is second half of 2017, especially within the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The two – second question about ASP trend. The ASP [indiscernible] (00:30:12) compare before because in this area we all provide the signal control system. So the CRC not give any three of us pressure within the price. And the third one for the 250 kilometers train procurement, it still have to wait from the information of CRC after Spring Festival. Currently we can just know from the CRC like until 2020 there will be 900 trains and use for the 300. But 200 still need to wait for the information. Thank you, Alex.

[Foreign Language] (00:30:59-00:31:43) The first question is [indiscernible] (00:31:49) trend, because we can see the second quarter of the industry automation, new contract just flat. So what about the trend for the coming two – next two quarters? And the second question is, focus on the, if [indiscernible] (00:32:11) can disclose breaking down industry better revenue of IA. Can you give us any sense of which special industry support or generated that the revenue increase?

[Foreign Language] (00:32:31-00:33:45) We confine these two questions together to answer. That industrial automation revenue mainly from the industry from power and chemical, petrochemical and the power including the coal fire, thermal, and new energy. And this area is increasing and as a trend for the whole fiscal year, we will keep the compare increase. The second – within a quarter maybe it have to fluctuate but the whole trend is positive and we believe at the end of fiscal year, we still can keep more than two digits growth either from the revenue and the new contracts. Thank you, Alex.

Thank you.

We'll go next to Jacqueline Du with Goldman Sachs.

[Foreign Language] (00:34:46-00:35:18) The question for the procurement we won, the 80 in trains for ADP, what about the deliver rate? It's all focused on the Spring Festival?

[Foreign Language] (00:35:31-00:36:30) Okay. The answer for the 80 trains of the procurement ATP we won, partially we deliver for the Spring Festival, not to all for the Spring Festival need. And also the supplement question for ask about the new procurement timeline for [indiscernible] (00:36:54) is it well within the third quarter or after March? It's hard to say the timeline because it's all dominated by CRC, the only customer, so we really have to wait for their information. Thank you.

We'll go next to Patrick Xu with Nomura.

[Foreign Language] (00:37:25-00:37:52) The first question is now on the high speed rail sector recently have accident for the train within the [indiscernible] (00:38:03) and can you describe some information about this accident? And the second one is for – we granted by the three intellectual program by central government, is there any subsidiary or any award by – from this grant?

[Foreign Language] (00:38:31-00:39:26) Okay. And the first, related to the accident, actually it is just a single equipment problem within the train. It's not too much affected by the problem in [indiscernible] (00:39:41). Everything right now [indiscernible] (00:39:45) in place. So it's not a very large and lead to any bad results. It's just our equipment fault, so but not related any signally controlled products. The second is for the 23 intelligence manufacturing system solution provider recommended by Ministry of Central Government. We will benefit from manifested [indiscernible] (00:40:18). For example, like we can carry on the large central government program and also we can – we have [indiscernible] (00:40:27) recognition by the industry can easy to expansion or factory automation business. Thank you. Actually because of the time restraint, so the one last question.

We'll take our last question from Thomas Zhang with Morgan Stanley.

[Foreign Language] (00:40:58-00:42:54) The first question is about – here I want to clarify two things. The 80 sets means the 80 sets of ATP. It works 40 trains, not the 80 trains. The second one and back to the question. The first question is doubted the 80 sets of the ATP contract is all from the 300. So we do not see any 200 area procurement. And especially the replacement equipment, if all comes from the 300 is it means there has been no replacement for the 200?

[Foreign Language] (00:43:57-00:44:36) And also the question is focused on the 80 sets, ATPs all for the new generation of the 300, is there any older ones? The answer is yes, all come from the new model of the 300, no old ones. And also the replacements we have but not winning this 80 sets. Actually is also booking to the upper sale revenue, right now not too much replacement. Maybe the cycle will start from several years later. This the first question, yeah. And the second question is about the R&D, R&D distribution; right now we also focus on the [indiscernible] (00:45:24) automation development and also the high speed railway has a new product like the track [indiscernible] (00:45:30). So how you allocated resource within R&D and the balance the expenditure.

[Foreign Language] (00:45:44-00:50:20) Actually the R&D expenditure from the numbers to see, it will have a little bit increase but not too much. This is as – as before, I mean, 6% to 8% of total revenues. But we want to emphasize from the R&D itself, we focus on the overlapping part of the share – share the platform like and also we emphasize the platform not a single product, the platform is for the solutions. But when we do the R&D, the engineers have overlapping part, for example, if electronic company wants to use part of the SCADA, it also can use the – to share with rail sector and also IA can also do the SCADA, so they can share the SCADA by the rail and IA.

So we emphasize the efficiency of the R&D to have this like a – like the overlapping part can reduce the R&D expenditure and also we want to say, I want to explain more about what we'll go to within the R&D right now. Beyond the rail factor like the factory automation, we emphasize our two phase. The first one is mechanical ability. This is focus on like the machine product, like will it meet the project, like Hai Di Lao after the [indiscernible] (00:51:59) they need us to provide a machine to replace the labor. So we have to raise our ability to provide the machine.

This is to emphasize the mechanical ability and also the [indiscernible] (00:52:12) area, they also focused on the machine mechanical [indiscernible] (00:52:18). But the second path is for the software or the technology based on solutions. This kind of solution is focused on the layer of data close to the equipment. For example like the proximity computing or like the data analyzing or data storage of the cloud, those kind of things, focus on the traditional industry upgrading, intelligence upgrading. So this area we have to provide a lot of new technology or new matter to combine with our existing products into a platform to assume that the solutions focused on different sub-verticals. So that's why the [indiscernible] (00:53:22) we actually have a lot of things to do and we are working on it. Thanks, Thomas.

[Foreign Language] (00:53:33)

Okay. Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got a chance to raise your questions, we will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We look forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.

That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.
