MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to the GSE Systems Second Quarter and Mid Year 2009


Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the


conference over to Mr. John Moran. Please go ahead, sir.


John V. Moran, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Welcome everyone to GSE’s mid year 2009 conference call.


I am John Moran, GSE’s CEO and I am joined here today by our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff


Hough.


Today’s call will begin with a brief overview of our second quarter and mid year 2009 financial


results. That will be followed by an update on our nuclear simulation, non-nuclear simulation and


training services business sectors.


We’ll conclude with some comments on what we expect for the balance of the year, followed by


about 30 minutes for any questions that you may have.


Before we begin, I would like to turn it over to Jeff to address the subject of forward-looking


statements.


Jeffery G. Hough, Chief Financial Officer


This presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding the future performance of GSE


Systems, Inc. that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially,


including but not limited to, economic conditions, customer demand, increased competition in the


relevant market and others. We refer you to the documents that the company files from time to time


with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K


reports, which contain additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ from its


current expectations and from the forward-looking statements made in this presentation.


John V. Moran, Chief Executive Officer


Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Okay, let’s begin with the financial summary. As noted in our press release, the


company reported that revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $10.65 million, a


62% increase from the revenue reported for the three months ended June 30, 2008 of $6.6 million.


GSE reported operating income of $658,000 for the second quarter 2009 as compared to an


operating loss of 148,000 in the second quarter of 2008. Net income for the June 30, 2009 quarter


was $571,000 or $0.04 per share on a basic basis and $0.03 per share on a fully diluted basis as


compared to a net loss of $270,000 or $0.02 per share on both a basic and diluted basis for the


second quarter of 2008.


GSE reported revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2009 of $18.8 million, a 38% increase


from the revenue reported for the first six months ended June 30, 2008 of $13.6 million. In the first


six months of 2009, the company generated $12.4 million or 66% of our total revenue from nuclear


simulation, $5.9 million or 31% of the total revenue from non-nuclear simulation and $441,000 or


3% of the total revenue from training and educational services.

GSE reported operating income of $1.189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as


compared to an operating loss of $322,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008. Net income


attributed to shareholders was $904,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 or $0.06 per


share on a basic basis and $0.05 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to a net loss of


$563,000 or $0.04 per share on both a basic and diluted basis for the six months ended June 30,


2008.


The company continues to utilize derivative instruments, specifically forward foreign exchange


contracts, to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange


rates on foreign-denominated trade receivables. The purpose and structure of the derivative


instruments GSE has entered into are designed to protect the contract value and margins at the


time the contracts are signed and are not designed to speculate on the direction of any currency


either up or down.


For the three months ended June 30, 2009, the company incurred $194,000 pre-tax non-cash gain


on its derivative instruments and this is reflected in the numbers that I just reported. GSE’s backlog


as of June 30, 2009 was approximately $62.3 million compared to $38 million at December 31,


2008. Backlog is defined as the remaining value of signed contracts and does not include any value


for contracts being negotiated or for contracts that have been signed since June 30, 2009.


In June, we announced that GSE had finalized contracts for the two new full scope nuclear


simulators in Japan; therefore the approximate $10 million of remaining value is included in the


contract backlog of 62.3 million. However, it does not include the expected value of the full scope


nuclear simulator currently being built for Westinghouse Electric Company’s Haiyang project in


China.


What’s important to understand is that we’ve been authorized to work on the Haiyang project and


we’re booking revenue on the initial phases of this work, no differently than any other project.


To conclude the financial discussion, the company filed an S-3 Shelf Registration with the SEC on


August 6, 2009. Our purpose for filing the Shelf Registration is that we want the company to have


all available options at its disposal should future opportunities present themselves.


Over the past 18 months or so, we’ve evaluated several interesting acquisition and joint venture


opportunities that would have required a capital component had we decided to move on them.


Having said that, I want to point out that we closed the quarter with over $5.5 million cash in the


bank in unused line of credit and we generated cash from operations. So this shelf filing simply


gives us added flexibility for potential, future opportunities.


Okay, let’s turn our attention now to the business sector updates. As most of you are aware, the


company has three business sectors, nuclear power simulation, non-nuclear power simulation and


our training and educational services sector. In the nuclear sector, customers around the world


continue to purchase our simulators to train and certify control room operators, engineers and


managers and to verify and validate new plant designs and control systems.


In the US, GSE has built or modified approximately 86 of the 100 full scope simulators in operation


today and on a global basis, we built or modified over 60% of the total number of nuclear power


plant simulators and that would be 75%, if France was eliminated from the calculation.


The company enjoys a very strong presence in the nuclear power industry and works with most


reactor vendors, contractors and operators, such as Westinghouse and NuScale here in the United


States, JAPC in Japan, Guangdong Nuclear in China, The Russian Research Institute and the


Pebble Bed Reactor in South Africa to name just a few.
