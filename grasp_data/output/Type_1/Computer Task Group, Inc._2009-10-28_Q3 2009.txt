MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 2009 Third Quarter


Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we


will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator


Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.


I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Debbie Pawlowski, Investor Relations


for CTG. Please go ahead.


Deborah K. Pawlowski, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Sandy and good morning everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your interest


in CTG. On the call today we have CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt, and Brendan


Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Brendan are going to review


the results for the third quarter of 2009 and update you on the company’s strategy and outlook.


We’ll follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing our financial


results, you can access it at the company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected. Additional information concerning factors that could cause


actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings


release, as well as in the company’s SEC filings. You can find these at our website or at the SEC’s


website at www.sec.gov. So please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these


precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Debbie, and good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us


this morning for our third quarter earnings conference call.


As you saw in our earnings release, while we were at the midpoint of our guidance for revenue, we


were pleased that we exceeded the high end of our guidance for earnings per share. It’s evidenced


by our increase in head count we’re beginning to see the early stages of the recovery in both our


solutions and staffing business.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the rest of the year. But first, I’m going


to ask Brendan to start this off with a review of our financial performance. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President


Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2009, CTG’s revenue was 68 – 66.8


million, a decrease of 22.4 million or 25%, compared with the third quarter of 2008. Operating


income was 2.5 million, a decrease of one million or 28%.


Operating margin decreased to 3.7% of revenue from last year’s 3.9%. However, when compared


with the trailing second quarter this year both revenue and operating margin improved slightly.

Net income was 1.6 million in the quarter, a decline of 23% from 2.1 million in the third quarter of


2008. On a per diluted share basis, net income was $0.10 for the quarter, a 23% decrease over last


year and $0.01 above the high end of our earnings guidance range. On a per share basis, earnings


were up $0.01 from the trailing second quarter.


Solutions revenue in the third quarter of 2009 was 23.6 million, a 14% decline from last year’s third


quarter. Solutions represented 35% of total revenue in the quarter, an improvement from 31% a


year ago, compared with the trailing second quarter, solutions revenue was up 2%.


Staffing revenue was down 30% to 43.2 million as compared with last year’s third quarter, and


down 1% compared with the trailing second quarter when staffing revenue was 43.5 million.


Third quarter revenue from IBM, our largest staffing customer was 17.2 million, compared with 28.7


million in the third quarter of 2008, but up slightly from 17.1 million in the trailing second quarter. As


a percent of total revenue, IBM was down to 26% in the third quarter 2009 compared with 32% of


total revenue in the third quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was 14.8 million, a 21% decrease from the 18.7 million


recorded in last year’s third quarter. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuation, European revenue in


the quarter would have decreased by 16% over last year, compared with the trailing second


quarter, European revenue was down 0.3 million. The third quarter is typically a weaker quarter in


the European operations because of the summer holiday schedule.


SG&A as a percent of revenue was 19% compared with 18.1% a year ago and 18.8% in the 2009


second quarter. We continue to manage cost very carefully as reflected in a 22% decrease in


operating expenses compared to last year. Direct cost as a percentage of revenue decreased to


77.2% in the third quarter, compared with 78% in the third quarter of 2008 and 77.5% in the second


quarter of 2009.


The 2009 third quarter results include equity compensation expense of approximately $0.02 per


diluted share and net of tax. The 2008 third quarter results included $0.01 per diluted share net of


tax for equity compensation expense. The tax rate for the 2009 third quarter was 35%, compared


with 39% in the 2008 third quarter. The rate was favorably impacted by certain federal and state tax


credits realized in the third quarter of 2009. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2009 to be


between 38 and 40%, which is lower than we had noted in our second quarter call.


We had approximately 2,800 employees at the end of the third quarter 2009, of which 88% were


billable resources. This was up from 2,700 at the end of the second quarter.


On the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding was 60 days compared with 58 days at the end


of the second quarter of 2009 and with 56 days at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The increase


was primarily a result of a change in the mix of revenue. Our cash used in operations in the third


quarter was approximately 2.9 million, as compared with cash provided from operations of 12


million in the third quarter of 2008. This difference was primarily due to the timing of the payment of


our payroll at quarter end.


The third quarter 2009 ended on a U.S. payroll date, whereas third quarter 2008 ended between


the payroll payment dates. We had 804,000 in capital expenditures in the quarter, focused mostly


on solutions development and recorded depreciation expense of 416,000 in the quarter. We expect


capital expenditures to be in the range of 3 million to 3.2 million for the full year.


CTG’s financial position remains very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 10.8


million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt outstanding on our $35 million revolving credit


agreement, which is in place through April 2011.
