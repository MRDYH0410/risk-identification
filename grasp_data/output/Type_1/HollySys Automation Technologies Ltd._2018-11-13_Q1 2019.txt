Thank you, Arden and greetings to everyone. I would like to discuss some key events [indiscernible] (00:03:39) this quarter. Industrial automation business recorded a 0.4% year-to-year growth in revenue at $57.7 million. New contract recorded a 9.9% year-to-year growth at $80.2 million. We continued to maintain our share in high-end power industry to execute the low-to-high end market expansion strategy in chemical and petrochemical industries and to build and maintain our industry in other verticals.

In power, major contracts we signed include DCS solution for Guohua Jinjie two unit 660 megawatt power and Shenhua Shengli two units 660 megawatts power. Contract growth in chemical and petrochemical remained healthy. Major contracts include additional SIS contract for the milestone Zhong'an United Coal Chemical Project and additional DCS contract for SINOPEC's p-xylene project. In addition to the efforts in gaining and maintaining market share in various industries, the company is paying adequate attention to the intelligence manufacturing based on sizable customer we have accumulated through decades, as it is a valuable asset for our long-term sustainable growth.

Leveraging our consistent emphasis on R&D, we continue to provide both regular and value-added services to our customers and to accompany them along the cause of better productivity. Our widespread national service network enables us to stay closer to the customers, to respond faster and to understand better.

Rail business recorded a 43.1% year-to-year growth in revenue at $50.4 million, while new contract increased sharply year-to-year at 866%, at $71.5 million. In high-speed rail business, new ATP contracts were signed this quarter, while CRC has published the bidding notice in mid-October for another 320 sets of ATP. Intake of heavy maintenance contracts are gradually seen as the ATPs are approaching their first 10 years maintenance cycle.

In subway business, we signed SCADA contracts on Shenzhen subway line 2 and line 8. Going forward, we will continue to strengthen our marketing capacity through reviewing and updating strategic partnership and improving local service network coverage for both high-speed railway and subway business. Management team will adhere to the diversity strategy to create revenue stream from more new products and services, and to maintain a stable and healthy growth into the future.

In oversea business, we continued to seek opportunities in industrial automation business through EPC projects and direct sales. Contracts were signed on DCS, DEH, BATCH, instrument integration, et cetera solution with customers from India and Southeast Asia in coal fire, thermal power, chemical and construction material, et cetera.

M&E business, performed by Concord and Bond, recorded at 34.2% year-to-year growth in revenue, at $30.6 million, and a 32% year-to-year growth in new contract, at $14.8 million. M&E will continue to act as a pioneer of internationalization for Hollysys, with [ph] growing (00:09:33) coordination to be built in between M&E and domestic business. Meanwhile, the economic and political circumstance in South East Asia and Middle East will continue to be closely followed.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steven Wang, who will lead the financial results analysis.

The gross margin fluctuation was mainly due to the different revenue mix with different margins.

Selling expenses were $7.7 million for the first quarter, representing an increase of $1.0 million or 15.1%, comparing to $6.7 million for the same quarter of the prior year, mainly due to the increased sales activities.

Operator, please.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Thomas Zhang from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:18:38-00:19:15)

Intake of heavy maintenance contracts are gradually seen as the ATPs are approaching [ph] there for 10-years (00:19:21) maintenance cycle.

[Foreign Language] (00:19:23-00:21:04)

The first question is no matter year-on-year compared for the first quarter or over quarter to compare the industrial automation and rail, new contract actually [indiscernible] (00:21:22), but why the backlog feel compared decrease [indiscernible] (00:21:27) it seems like not it makes equal?

The second question about the ATP question. The maintenance cycle for the ten years – at ten years, is the CRC the only customer [indiscernible] (00:21:45) contracted privately or just a common standardized meeting and also what we do for the maintenance. Is our entire product change or the components or the other things change gradually?

The third question is about R&D expense. Actually at the beginning of this year, you mentioned not give guidance, so I suppose that the expense going to increase, but right now, the R&D as the percentage of total revenue decrease. So I want to ask about what about the coming one or two years this proportion and also how you manage the R&D?

[Foreign Language] (00:22:44-00:23:50)

The first question about the backlog. Actually backlog compare just a increase 3% to 4% but its new contract compare increase a lot. Because of this fiscal year according to the ASC 606, the new principle of the U.S. GAAP, we adopt from July 1 [indiscernible] (00:24:19) contracted revenue recognition are changing from special performance [ph] method (00:24:26) into percentage of completion [ph] in light to several one-off effects (00:24:30), our financials result including backlog. This part influence around the CNY 240 million versus $35 million roughly. And this new standard also influenced just the balance sheet of accounts. So this is why this part you could see a little bit difference between new contract increase rate [indiscernible] (00:25:03) and also the backlog.

[Foreign Language] (00:25:07-00:26:57)

The question still refers to the backlog numbers but actually, the answer is [indiscernible] (00:27:06) influence just that $35 million and it's just the time of point of recognition revenue but actually, the whole quarter recognized revenue just compare a little bit fast but this is influenced by our end customer, but we also followed by the percent of completion. So current base still in the healthy range. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:27:41-00:28:22)

Okay. The maintenance about the high-speed rail, it emphasize on the electronic components. And we discuss with the CRC, the only customer we settle down, all the providers settle down the same thing. 7 to 10 years is our time for the maintenance and also replacement because we want to secure the reliability of the whole railway transportation operation. And the CRC and our providers together to set up this rules that just between 7 to 10 years changing the internal components regularly, so that the large component not changed but inside of each unit and all components we gradually to change.

[Foreign Language] (00:29:24-00:30:39)

About the R&D expense, actually for the yearly target, we give the range is 6% to 8% of total revenues. This is still in the range. And from the actual value, you can see this quarter still with a good number. And also we want to emphasize beyond R&D – actually, we also finished R&D activity by the other activities, for example, the investment or M&A potential to make the sufficient support for the R&D purposes. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:31:23-00:31:42)

The last question, have you any evaluate about – in the past 10 years if you're start to do the maintenance or replacement, what about the price or the potential market value for those part?

[Foreign Language] (00:32:05-00:32:27)

This part, I have no exactly data for your reference, but in future, we will have to share to you for a better landscape. But generally speaking, for the gross margin, we have no change. And also this kind of [indiscernible] (00:32:46) the components, we also have our own price strategy. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:32:54)

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jacqueline Du from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:33:06-00:34:46)

Okay. The first question is about the railway transportation new order increase a lot. Could you separate the ATP, TCC, the maintenance and also any [indiscernible] (00:35:02) contracts? And the second – and also right now [indiscernible] (00:35:08) see the trend for the open [indiscernible] (00:35:10) or the completion of the construction for the rail is very – it's just a start and what about your [indiscernible] (00:35:18) for the whole 2019 calendar year?

And second question is about the IA, industry automation, new contract is $80 million level and this is still a good level. Could you explain a little bit about [indiscernible] (00:35:37) verticals trend, I mean power, chemical, [indiscernible] (00:35:42)?

And the last question is about the [indiscernible] (00:35:45) cases. This represents [indiscernible] (00:35:49) industry and what about the [indiscernible] (00:35:52) transit ability to the other areas up to that range?

[Foreign Language] (00:36:05-00:36:23)

The first question, we actually would not disclosed the separate [indiscernible] (00:36:30) number for the ATP, TCC maintenance. And by the way, we included the [indiscernible] (00:36:37) contract at this quarter, just the high-speed rail [indiscernible] (00:36:43) line.

[Foreign Language] (00:36:46-00:37:53)

Okay. We also not disclose the [indiscernible] (00:37:59) number exactly, but I can tell you about the roughly range. [ph] No matter (00:38:06) revenue on new contract within IA, the power around the 40% to 45% and also the same with the chemical, petrochemical and by the way power including that coal fire, thermal power and new energy, and the 5% roughly around from the new nuclear power and the 10% to 15% from others, like the [indiscernible] (00:38:29) those kind of industries. And the coal fire new construction is slowing down but from the actual value still okay because we have tremendous [indiscernible] (00:38:43) of track records, we can do the other maintenance upgrading potential contracts. So this is the base [indiscernible] (00:38:53) spread of the industries.

[Foreign Language] (00:38:57-00:39:45)

The highly [indiscernible] (00:39:51) case, we help them to finish the kitchen side automation work. This is including like the automatic preparing the [indiscernible] (00:40:05) area, it's like a different [ph] radiance (00:40:07) to automatic integrated together and also the [indiscernible] (00:40:13) function. And we want to achieve the purpose of the highly [indiscernible] (00:40:23) itself. They want to do the automation to do the standardized and also want to finish the increase of their satisfaction from the customer. And we already signed for the contract with the other franchise. They want to – through this case to deliver to the other franchise.

[Foreign Language] (00:40:56-00:42:11)

I want to make – emphasize on the [indiscernible] (00:42:20) case. Actually, it's very significant because from the customer settle down the order from the [indiscernible] (00:42:29) and transferred to the kitchen side and the whole thing is the system execution and reflect the whole process is automatic. This is also through the MES, the whole production manufacturing process. And also [indiscernible] (00:42:48) objectives also including the solid material and the liquid material. So it's a kind of improve of our capability of the team to focus on the different [ph] situation (00:43:08) of the working conditions to make the manufacturing or intellectual manufactory product. So this is very good and simple and also can reinforce our capability to provide more complex conditions, automation work in future [indiscernible] (00:43:31).

[Foreign Language] (00:43:31-00:44:11)

And we very expected the [indiscernible] (00:44:18) this party future performance. And by the way, our return to my question about the rail ATP, for example about the 320 sets, how many do deliver currently and what about the price? And also the last thing is I also want to focus on the landscape or expectation for the whole 2019 calendar year performance. Can you explain a little bit more about this? Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:44:56-00:45:46)

The ATP contract for this calendar year 2019, right now have two batches of the bidding, one is – or for 300. One is in August around – totally around 190 sets of the ATP, and we won 52 sets. And the second batch in October 16 around 320 sets. But right now, we not signed contract yet, so we cannot disclose its number. We will see later and well do the press release for [indiscernible] (00:46:33).

And generally speaking, the high-speed rail, the total investment no changing and also our market share very stable. So we are very optimistic for the 2019 whole fiscal year. And later, we will still provide a lot of service contracts and also new product contract as a supplement. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:47:01-00:47:05)

And I want to confirm about the unit price now changing right? The answer is yes. Thank you.

Due to the time constraint, we will now take one last question.

Your last question comes from the line of Gary Cheung from Haitong International. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:47:34-00:49:06)

Okay. The first question about the U.S. new principle – the GAAP principle and this year to start [ph] reflecting (00:49:18) from your financials. And could you give me a little bit about the data before no change before about the backlog number? This could better for us to contrast the differences.

And the second question about the IA new contract, the revenue just compare increase flat and the new contract compare increase. And what about your sales area expenditure if there any other significant growth? And also about the new order, I want to say – or new contract, I want to ask about any cancel situation?

The last question for – you said the CNY 240 million backlog influenced by the service contract and – but beyond this influence, we also could see the backlog a little bit pulling down, so is there any particular IA area industries not good right now?

[Foreign Language] (00:50:32-00:53:20)

The question for the first one is we will – to answer the question about the comparison of that recovery result of the backlog. But actually, I want to also emphasize, the $35 million still that make difference between – including the service contract. And also the second one for the new contract, we have – and even the backlog, we have no any cancellation. Actually, this part is also stable. We have the latest cycle of the automation work by the way. And for the long term to see that the revenue and the backlog should be at the same trend, [indiscernible] (00:54:14) have differences but no [indiscernible] (00:54:18) relationship between each other. I mean actually, [indiscernible] (00:54:22) it depends on the recognized revenue, actually the percent of completion of our implementing work by the customer side.

And the last question also including the same as the first two questions, beyond the $35 million influence maybe still have the currency exchange rate. If you are calculated these two things that – our backlog actually compare increase 12%. This is a little bit soft than the revenue and also you could use that, it's slowing down, but actually, this kind of fluctuation in the normal range just like what I said have no [indiscernible] (00:55:08) relationship. It just depends on different [indiscernible] (00:55:12) it's just a difference depends on the percent of completion.

[Foreign Language] (00:55:19-00:56:35)

The question is about the focus on IA industrial automation. And this part, do you have see any verticals special decline or from a contract [ph] size need (00:56:47) the cancellation or the other things, just focus on the industrial automation?

And actually our IA, the customer side at the – more than 90% already investment to finish the infrastructure and also finish the equipment procurement [indiscernible] (00:57:06) automation, so that's why we [indiscernible] (00:57:10) very few I mean – actually no any cancellation of the contract situation. And also the backlog – also the new contract in the past 10 quarters, if you see the [ph] actual (00:57:24) value, normally in the range of $50 million to $60 million but this quarter still above $80 million, in the high range. So the momentum still very good by our side.

And by verticals, it's just a [indiscernible] (00:57:42) those industries still not good, but actually, the main generator from the power and chemicals, petrochemicals still strong with our side. This is also including – we increase above the average of the industry growth. It also depends on our internally strengthen our penetration for the market share. So these elements influence the total momentum of the new contract of IA.

[Foreign Language] (00:58:13-00:58:30)

And I want to make supplement about this industrial automation entire environmental market circumstances. Actually from our side that we're not seeing [indiscernible] (00:58:44) declining of particular industry, so we still can maintain the momentum right now.

Thank you, Gary. Thank you every one for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got a chance to raise questions, we will pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We're looking forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.

That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect.
