MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Miss Liz


Brandel. Miss Brandel, you may begin.


Elizabeth Brandel, Vice President of Finance


Thank you. I will be reading the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this


conference call, which are not strictly historical, are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements


involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the


company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as with other filings with the SEC could affect the company's


actual results and could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results.


The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to the forward-looking statements or


any fact, events, or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.


During the conference call we may refer to our total debt-to-capitalization percentage. This is


calculated by using the total debt as numerator and the total debt plus shareholder equity in the


denominator. We consider this ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of the company's


balance sheet. It is not a measure in accordance of GAAP accounting principles, and is not a


measure of net income, cash flow, or liquidity. And with that, I'll pass the call to Mark Miller.


Mark C. Miller, President, CEO and Director


Thanks, Liz. Well, good afternoon and welcome to our Third Quarter 2005 Conference Call. With


me today are Frank ten Brink, our Chief Financial Officer, Rich Kogler, Chief Operating Officer, and


you hear from Liz, our Vice President of Finance. Once again, we're pleased with the results


achieved by our team in the third quarter. Our net income in the third quarter was $23.4 million and


EPS was 52 cents. Without the impairment charge by 3CI [ph], EPS would have been 52 cents per


share. The 37 consecutive quarters since our IPO in '06 we've either met or exceeded


expectations for our company's performance. With that brief overview, I'll turn the all over to Frank.


Frank ten Brink, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer


Thanks, Mark. Revenues grew $17.2 million in the quarter to $153.2 million, up 12.6% from $136


million in Q3 of '04. Up to $17.2 million growth, SQ, our most profitable sector, was up


approximately $6.1 million or 9%, and LQ revenues were up approximately $2.3 million or 6%.


International equipment sales were down by approximately $1.6 million in the quarter. Acquisitions


less than 12 months old contributed approximately 7.4 million for the quarter. Customer revenue


mix was approximately 63% in small and 37% in large customers. As in the past, this mix is


calculated excluding international operations, 3CI [ph] and acquisitions. Year-over-year gross profit


as a percent or revenue was 44.1% in the quarter versus 43.5% last year, up 60 basis points.


Gross margins were sequentially up by 35 basis points as the result of continued improvement in


our base business both domestically and internationally, partially offset by continued operating cost


head winds. SG&A excluding amortization was 15.7% of revenues, or 24.1 million in the quarter,


due to increased investment spending. And income from operations in the quarter was 42 million,


or 27.4% of revenues, which includes the 3CI 1-time pre-tax, non-cash charge of 0.9 million.


Net interest expense in the third quarter was 3 million versus 3.1 million in the prior year. Other


expense was 0.5 million versus 0.3 million in the prior year due to non-cash currency translation


charges. net income from the third quarter was 23.4 million and EPS was 52 cents for the quarter

versus 46 cents last year. There was 0.006 of a 1-time write off in incineration of 0.872 million pre-


tax, or approximately 0.1 cent EPS impact. At the end of the third quarter, the revolver borrowings


were 182 million. The unused portion of our revolver is now approximately 171 million.


During the quarter, we repurchased 146.6 thousand shares, so 146 600 [ph] shares, of common


stock on the open market in an amount of approximately 8.1 million. We bought back 2,144,230


shares at this point. In the quarter, our CapEx was 6.2 million. The DSO in the quarter was 53


days versus 52 days a year ago. And now with some balance sheet numbers. Cash and


equivalents, 4.1 million; accounts receivable, 90 million; current assets 135.3 million; total assets,


934.8 million; short-term debt, 12 million; long-term debt, 235.3 million for a total debt of 247.3


million. The net worth of the company was 532 million. Depreciation in the quarter was 4.9 million,


and amortization was a half a million. And our DSO in the quarter was 53 days.


Now for the 9 months. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2005, revenues increased to 442.9


million, an increase of 17.4% from the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of


revenue was 43.8% for the 9 months ended September 30, 2005 versus 44.4% for the 9 months


ended September 30, 2004. Earnings per share increased 17.2% to $1.50 from $1.28 per diluted


share in the same period a year ago. Cash provided from operations was 91.2 million for the first 9


months of '05. That concludes the financial picture. I will now pass it back to Rich.


Richard T. Kogler, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer


Thanks, Frank. We want to begin by thanking the operating team for all of their hard work and


effort to what proved to be a very challenging quarter. Thanking the operating team for all their


hard work and efforts of what proved to be a very challenging quarter. In the face of continued


operating cost head winds, they once again delivered sequential gross margin improvements.


Throughout the quarter, all operating locations stayed focused on improving productivity and


efficiency to help offset rapidly rising energy costs. Special recognition goes out to our operating


sales team members who live and work in the areas affected by the hurricanes. Despite the


incredible operational challenges posed by the hurricane damage, they did whatever it took to


make sure our customer’s needs were met. Whether it involved working around the clock to restart


our plants or driving long days and long distances to reach customers or helping to reestablish


communication links with our many affected customers, all of our team members did their part and


gave their all. We salute them and we thank them for the dedication and extraordinary efforts


during this particularly difficult time. Turning now to sales, we enjoyed strong growth in all areas of


our business.


The sales team focused their energies on our key growth drivers: including Steri Safe and Bio


Systems and once again, turned in a solid performance in the quarter. The SQG sales team


continued to emphasize the strategy of up selling new and existing accounts into the higher level


Steri Safe programs. In Q3, over a third of the new Steri Safe customers opted for the select and


preferred programs. The percentage of total Steri Safe accounts on premium levels rose to 12.5%.


Since the higher level programs offer significant benefits to us and our customers, we've committed


additional investment spend in this area of our sales program. Because of the sales team


continued success, Steri Safe contributed approximately 42% of total SG revenues in the quarter


achieving now the low-end of our 2005 goal of 42 to 43% of revenues. During the quarter, our


large account team secured 51 new LQG and med waste contracts and they also signed 65 new


Bio Systems accounts. And in summary, we ended Q3 with 331,300 accounts of which 323,600


were small and 7,700 were large accounts. And I'll turn it back to Mark.
