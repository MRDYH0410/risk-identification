MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello. And welcome to the Encore Wire First Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder all


lines will be on listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&A session at the end of the call. [Operator


Instructions]


At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel L. Jones, President and CEO to begin. Please


go ahead.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Eric. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Encore Wire Corporation


Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive Officer of


Encore Wire.


With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer. We are pleased to announce


these are earnings in the midst of the tough competitive environment we are experiencing in our


industry and a slump in the overall to the US economy, which despite the abundance of negative


news in the media, our unit volumes were down only 4% in the first quarter of ‘08 to the first quarter


of ‘09 and increased 8.5% in the first quarter of ‘09 versus the fourth quarter of ‘08.


The current financial crisis has raised uncertainty amongst builders and buyers of buildings across


America. This uncertainty has also affected our competitors and created a volatile pricing


environment and our industry that compress the spread between what we paid for a pound of


copper versus what we were able to charge the wire that contained a pound of copper.


In the first quarter of 2009, this spread fell by 23% versus the first quarter of ‘08 and it fell by 41%


versus the fourth quarter of ‘08. We were tempted to lead the industry with several price increases


during the quarter, but met limited success as the average price of wire sold dropped 26%, while


copper cost declined only 16% on a sequential quarter basis.


Our reps in the field also tell us that the volatility of copper over the last year coupled with declining


industry volumes has caused many of our distributor customers to lean down their inventory levels.


The low inventory levels in the distribution chain makes Encore’s excellent order fill rates more


valuable to customers who are gravitating towards a just-in-time inventory.


We believe our volume decreases are less than total industry and we believe that we are able to


get a slight premium for our service level from customers who realize they are saving money by


buying from us. Making $0.20 per share in this economy is an impressive accomplishment and we


thank our employees and associates for their tremendous efforts.


I want to thank our share holders for their continued support. Frank?


Frank J. Bilban, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute, we’ll review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we’ll take any questions you may have.


Each of you should have received a copy of Encore’s press release covering our financial results.


This release is available on the Internet or you can call Denise Liss at 800-962-9473 and we’ll get


you a copy.

Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in these initial comments and in the question-


and-answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking. In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to


identify each particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements


involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those


discussed today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more


detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this conference call to the


most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including


EBITDA, which we believe to be useful supplemental information for investors, are posted on


www.encorewire.com under press releases.


Now, the financial results, net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 were $144.5 million


compared to $281.8 million during the first quarter of 2008. Total dollar sales and average selling


prices fell due to declining copper prices. Net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $4.6 million


versus 13.6 million in the first quarter of ‘08. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were


$0.20 in the first quarter of ‘09 versus $0.58 in the first quarter of ‘08.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the first quarter of 2009 were144.5 million versus


$180.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $4.6


million versus 16.7 million in the fourth quarter of ‘08. Fully diluted net earnings per common share


were $0.20 in the first quarter of 2009 versus $0.72 in the fourth quarter of ‘08.


As usual the true story behind our earnings fluctuation is in the spread between what we paid for a


pound of copper versus what we were able to charge for wire that contained a pound of copper. As


Daniel indicated, in the first quarter of ‘09, this spread fell by 23% versus the first quarter of 2008


and it fell by 41% versus the fourth quarter of 2008.


These spreads rose in the comparison periods of ‘08 and then fell back in ‘09 amidst the price


cutting we witnessed in the industry in the first quarter of 2009. Investors who have followed us for


something and understand the dynamics of this business have always focused on the spread as


the key driver of our earnings and understand that LIFO adjustments are consistently applied. LIFO


serves to bring the latest cost of materials into the statements and allow these spreads to be


accurately included in our results in a timely fashion.


Our low cost structure enables us to continue to produce earnings in these turbulent times. We


continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. The only long-term debt we have as of March 31,


2009 is $100 million in long-term notes due in 2011 with a $150 million revolving line of credit


standing at a zero balance.


In addition, we have $230.7 million in cash as of March 31, 2009. We were also pleased to declare


our 10th consecutive quarterly cash dividend during the first quarter of 2009. We want every one to


know that this conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion of this session. If you


wish to hear the taped replay please call 866-551-45-20 and enter the conference reference


number 247273#. This information is also posted on the Internet.


I’ll now turn the floor back over to Daniel Jones our President and CEO. Daniel?


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. As Frank highlighted, we feel Encore performed well in the past quarter. We believe


we’re well positioned for the future.
