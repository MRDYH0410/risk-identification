...in bioequivalence to their current commercialized product.


On slide 14, two bullet of importance, unfortunately due to various government-related and fiscal and


administrative matters, the project with TechPar of Brazil have encountered unforeseen delays and somewhat just


like expected and discussed during the annual meeting following various exchange and attempts to rectify the


situation, Prometic and TechPar mutually agreed to terminate their license and development agreement in late


Q2.


During the first half of the same period, obviously we moved forward on the development of several therapeutics


derived from proteins, and several key milestones were achieved for various programs, enabling these to move to


their next respective phase of development. Not all of those announced can be turned into news, but we're very,

Abraxis, but Abraxis being a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. At this point in time, we've received


confirmation that it is business as usual with regards to all projects Prometic has been pursuing with Abraxis. As


you all know that Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the founder and majority shareholder of Abraxis, remains on board


along with Bruce Wendel, the CEO of Abraxis and a board member of ProMetic. It is also worth mentioning that


Dr. Soon-Shiong has become now one of the largest shareholder in Celgene.


Slide 16 will hopefully help remind our shareholders of the amazing performance that ProMetic's business


strategy has achieved in Protein Technologies. Business has now created a long-term strategic agreement with


several companies. On the left, you have typical biotech group with whom we've partnered with or use our
