MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello and welcome to Vector Group’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Earnings


Conference Call. Before the call begins, I’d like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.


I’d now like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber. You may begin.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s fourth quarter and year


end 2008 earnings conference call. With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of


Liggett Vector Brands and Liggett; and Bryant Kirkland, Vector’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call I will provide an overview of our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2008. Ron will then discuss the performance


of Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco for the period, and provide an update on recent industry


developments in the competitive environment. After that, we’ll take your questions.


Let me begin by highlighting that our conventional tobacco business continued its positive trend of


earnings growth in 2008 with operating income for the year increasing by $10.8 million or 6.8%. We


are pleased with our performance in 2008 and remain confident about our prospects going forward.


However, we also recognize that the $0.62 per pack federal excise tax increase that becomes


effective April 1, 2009 will have an impact on the cigarette industry as a whole, as well as on our


performance. Ron will cover this in more detail, following my review of Vector Group’s financial


results.


Before discussing the financial results for the quarter and year, I would also like to note that our


liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $211.1 million as of


December 31, 2008. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we held investment securities and


partnership interest with a fair market value of approximately 83.5 million.


Now let’s turn to the key financials for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2008 for


Vector Group.


Our financial results for the fourth quarter 2008 includes pre-tax impairment charges of $25.4


million on long-term investments, real estate and investment securities and pre-tax gains of 16.5


million from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within our convertible debt and a


583,000 pre-tax gain from our interest in the St. Regis Hotel in Washington D.C.


Our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007 included pre-tax charges of


1.9 million from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within the convertible debt.


Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2008 include 32.4 million of pre-tax


impairment charges on long-term investments, real estate and investment securities and pre-tax


gains of approximately 24.3 million from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within our


convertible debt and approximately 12.6 million of pre-tax income from our interest in the St. Regis


Hotel in Washington D.C.

Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2007 include income of 19.6 million from the


March 2007 settlement between New Valley and the U.S. government, an 8.1 million pre-tax gain


from the exchange of notes receivable from Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services for Ladenburg


common stock and accrued interest and pre-tax charges of 6.1 million from changes in fair value of


derivatives embedded within convertible debt.


For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, Vector Group revenues were 144.4 million


compared to 145.1 million in the 2007 fourth quarter. The company recorded operating income of


35.4 million compared to operating income of 36.9 million in the 2007 fourth quarter.


Fourth quarter 2008 net income was 12.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to net


income of 14.2 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the 2007 period.


Excluding the impairment charges, gains on changes in the fair value of derivatives embedded


within our convertible debt and income from the St. Regis, the company’s net income for the 2008


fourth quarter was 17.2 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Excluding the change – the charge,


excuse me, for changes in the fair value of derivatives embedded within our convertible debt, the


company’s net income for the 2007 fourth quarter was 15.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share.


For the year ended December 31, 2008, Vector Group revenues were 565.2 million, compared to


555.4 million in 2007. The company recorded operating income of 135.3 million, compared to 125.5


million for 2007. Net income was 60.5 million or $0.80 per diluted common share, compared to net


income of 73.8 million or $1.07 per share in 2007.


Excluding the income from the St. Regis, the gains from the changes in the fair value of derivatives


embedded within our convertible debt and the impairment charges in 2008, net income was 57.8


million for the year or $0.85 per diluted share. Excluding the Ladenburg note exchange, the gain


from the U.S. government lawsuit settlement and the charge from the changes in the fair value of


derivatives embedded within our convertible debt, the company’s net income for 2007 was 61


million or $0.89 per diluted share.


Now I will turn the call over to Ron Bernstein for a review of the key financials for our Liggett and


Vector Tobacco subsidiaries. Liggett’s numbers reflect sales of both Liggett Group cigarettes and


conventional cigarette products from Vector Tobacco. Ron?


Ronald J. Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Liggett Group Inc. and Liggett


Vector Brands Inc.


Thanks, Howard, and good morning to everyone. As Howard indicated, we are very pleased with


our 2008 performance. Over the past several years, we’ve established and executed upon a


strategy that strikes a balance between earnings and volume growth, and we believe that our


continued strong performance validates that approach. We’re especially pleased that we’ve been


able to sustain earnings growth over the past several years, despite operating in increasingly


challenging industry conditions and more recently in a decidedly more negative economic


environment.


As Howard mentioned, we are now facing a new challenge with the recently passed $0.62 per pack


increase to the federal excise tax that’s being used to pay for the State Children’s Health Insurance


Program or SCHIP. While the SCHIP program which helps provide insurance to uninsured children


of families with modest incomes has merit, it has no connection to the tobacco industry. While it’s


our position that this tax is arbitrary, discriminatory and regressive, it is now law and we will deal


with its consequences.
