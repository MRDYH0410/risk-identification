However, with disposition of these assets associated with the Cylinder business in December 2004


and the disposition of the excess product line that included a line of excess equipment for the


petrochemical industry in February of this year, the remainder Green’s products include a line of


post hole digging equipment for the agricultural industry.


Now I will take a moment to review the quarterly performance at each of our units, but before I start,


let me just note that Florida Pneumatic, as stated in our press release, effective March 31, 2005,


Franklin Manufacturing was merged into our Florida Pneumatic subsidiary from Countrywide


Hardware. Franklin’s first quarter sales of $1.2 million and operating results are included in Florida


Pneumatic figures for the quarter and for the comparable quarter from last year.


Franklin sale for 2004 was also $1.2 million. The Franklin operation, which has been located


Farmingdale, New York is now located in Florida Pneumatic Jupiter facility.


Now on to the numbers, Florida Pneumatic accounted for 37% of consolidated revenues for the first


quarter, revenues including those of Franklin Manufacturing for both periods decrease by 4.9%


from 10.6 million in the first quarter of 2004 and 10.1 million in the first quarter of 2005, due to


delays in the launching of large promotion of significant customer and a further reduction of sales in


the first quarter of this year versus [ph] first quarter of last year to a previously significant customer.


Although this customer has been lost at the end of 2003, there had been several months of residual


sales in the first quarter of 2004 and this was partially offset by an increase in base sales including


new product sales of 900,000 barrels. Gross profit at Florida Pneumatic decreased from to 31.1%


from 31.9% due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Taiwanese dollar. This was


partially offset by a more favorably product mix. Countrywide Hardware accounted for 52% of


consolidated revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the first quarter of this year increased by


329% from 3.3 million to 14.2 million due primarily to the inclusion of Woodmark International’s


revenues of $10 million. Woodmark sales have remained strong since we acquired the company in


June of last year. Gross profit in Countrywide decreased from 36.9% to 32.2% with a significant


increase in revenues due primarily to the inclusion of Woodmark’s lower average margins.


Countrywide and Woodmark had to sustain some cost increases from Asian supplies due to


increases in the cost of metals somewhat offset nationwide by the continued shift to lower cost


suppliers for some products. OEM and patio hardware sales in Nationwide were up 43.5% and


12.8% respectively reflecting new customers in OEM and incremental patio hardware sales due to


reconstruction following the Hurricane in Florida last year. Embassy accounted for approximately


9% of revenues for the quarter. Embassy’s revenue for the first quarter of this year were


essentially flat when compared to the prior year at $2.5 million. Embassy raised prices late in the


first quarter of 2005 in order to return to the margin levels that have been reduced by material cost


increase this and in the fourth quarter of last year. These material cost increases was the primary


reason that gross margin at Embassy decreased from 29.1% in the first quarter of 2004 to 25.6%


for the first quarter of 2005. Well our sales on the commercial product and boiler sales were weak


for this quarter, this was offset by strong standard baseboard sales and how this task continue to


strengthen the primary market for our baseboard to Northeast region. And lastly, our Green


Manufacturing subsidiary accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated revenues for the quarter.


Revenues from Green Manufacturing’s continuing operations, which only include the agricultural


product division, increased 17.1% to $525,595 from $448,843 in the first quarter of 2004. This is


primarily due to the addition of the new customer at the end of 2004. Margins have decreased from


23.2% in the first quarter of 2005 to 17.1% due to material cost increases, increased overhead, and


an unfavorable product mix.


Please note that the consolidated financial statements have been re-classified to reflect the loss


from continued operations of Green Manufacturing’s access equipment division, which resulted


from a disposition of certain assets in February 2005 to a non-affiliated third party. Net of tax


benefits, losses from discontinued operations for the quarter were approximately 145,000 including


a net gain of approximately $71,000 in the sale of these assets. Proceeds from the sale of these


assets were used to pay down debt. Disposition was part of the strategy to focus management


resource on other segments of our business in order to add greater shareholder value.
