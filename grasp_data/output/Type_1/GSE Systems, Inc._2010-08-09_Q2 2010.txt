MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Please stand by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the GSE Systems’ Incorporated


Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this


time, I’d like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Moran. Please go


ahead, sir.


John V. Moran, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to GSE’s 2010 mid-year conference call. I’m


John Moran, GSE’s Chief Executive Officer. I’m joined here today with our Chief Financial Officer,


Jeff Hough.


Today’s call will begin with a brief overview of our second quarter and first half 2010 financial


results. That will be followed by an overview and an update on several very material and exciting


announcements that we’ve made since our last call, specifically our acquisition of TAS Holdings,


the formation of our joint-venture in China with Beijing-based UNIS Investment Company, and our


first domestic plant-specific Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear simulation contract.


I’ll then comment regarding my plans to retire from GSE at the end of October and discuss Jim


Eberle’s initial areas of focus over the next few months as well as his role moving forward. As most


of you are aware, Jim joined GSE as its Chief Operating Officer on June 1. He was originally


scheduled to join me and Jeff here today, but was called to China to pursue some very exciting new


opportunities that are developing there.


I’ll conclude with some closing comments and a general outlook for the balance of 2010 followed by


time for any questions that you might have. But before we begin, I’d like to turn it over to Jeff to


address the subject of forward-looking statements.


Jeffery G. Hough, Chief Financial Officer


This presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding the future performance of GSE


Systems, Inc. that involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially,


including but not limited to, economic conditions, customer demand, increased competition in the


relevant market and others.


We refer you to the documents that the company files from time to time with the Securities and


Exchange Commission, such as the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K report, which contain


additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ from its current expectation and


from the forward-looking statements made in this presentation.


John V. Moran, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Jeff. As noted in our press release today, the company reported revenue for the three


months ended June 30, 2010 of $11.8 million, that’s a 10.5% increase from the revenue reported


for the three months ended June 30, 2009 of $10.7 million.


GSE reported operating income of $751,000 for the second quarter of 2010 as compared to


operating income of $658,000 in the second quarter of 2009. Net income for the second quarter of


2010 was 370,000 or $0.02 per share on both the basic and diluted basis as compared to net


income of $571,000 or $0.04 per share on a basic basis and $0.03 per share on a diluted basis for


the second quarter of 2009.

GSE reported revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2010 of $23 million, a 22.4% increase


from the revenue reported for the six-months ended June 30, 2009 of $18.8 million. For the six


months ended June 30, 2010, the company generated $17 million or 74% of our total revenue from


nuclear simulation, 5 million or 22% of our total revenue from non-nuclear simulation and 915,000


or 4% of our total revenue from the training and education services sector.


GSE reported operating income of $1,204 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 as


compared with an operating income of $1,189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The


company generated net income of $819,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 or $0.04 per


share on both the basic and diluted basis, compared to net income of $904,000 or $0.06 per share


on a basic basis and $0.05 per share on a diluted basis for the six months ended June 30, 2009.


The company continues through the first six months of the year to have zero borrowings against its


revolving line of credit with Bank of America and in fact, negotiated an increase of $1.5 million, that


is from $6 million to $7.5 million in total availability. The company’s cash balance at June 30, 2010


was $25.9 million and today, it exceeds $30 million.


GSE, as most of you know, periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage


market risks associated with the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign-


denominated trade receivables. Again, the purpose and structure of the foreign exchange contracts


that GSE has entered into are designed to protect the contract value and margins at the time the


contracts are signed, and are not designed to speculate on the direction of any currency, up or


down.


Keep in mind that the gain or loss reported due to these contracts will net out to zero at the time the


contract expires. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, the company incurred a $374,000


pre-tax non-cash loss on its foreign exchange contracts.


For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the company incurred a $678,000 pre-tax non-cash loss


on its foreign exchange contracts. Excluding the impact of this loss, GSE’s net income for the three


months ending June 30, 2010 would have increased to $641,000 or $0.03 per share on both a


basic and diluted basis. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, net income would have increased


to $1.35 million or $0.07 on both a basic and diluted basis.


GSE’s backlog as of June 30, 2010 was approximately $49.8 million, compared to $53.9 million at


the end of 2009. Backlog is defined as the remaining value of signed contracts and does not


include any value for contracts being negotiated or for contracts that have been signed since June


30, 2010. Of the $49.8 million backlog, 73% was in the nuclear simulation sector, 23% in the non-


nuclear sector, and 4% in the training and services sector.


The backlog of $49.8 million does not include roughly $7 million of the $15 million of new nuclear


sector simulation awards announced in our June 6 and June 29 press releases. Included in this $7


million of new awards not in the backlog was a contract to build the first U.S. based AP1000


nuclear power plant simulator. The $49.8 million backlog also does not include approximately $3.3


million of the $4.3 million of new non-nuclear awards that we announced on August 5, primarily for


new gas and coal-fired plants being constructed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in Chile.


In total therefore, it is important to note that the $49.8 million backlog does not include a total of


approximately $10.3 million in awards received since the quarter closed on June 30, 2010. So,


we’re currently sitting on a contract backlog at near record levels.


At this point in the conference call, I generally provide a summary of activity at each of the


company’s three business sectors. However, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, since our last


call, we’ve made a series of very important and exciting announcements that have the potential


over time to significantly accelerate our growth rate and our presence in a number of targeted


markets and geographies.
