MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining the Encore Wire Quarterly Earnings Conference


Call. As a reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode, and we will conduct a Q&A session at the


end of the call. At this time, it is my pleasure to present Mr. Daniel Jones, the President of Encore


Wire.


Daniel Jones, President and COO


Thank you, Tara. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Encore Wire Corporation


First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Operating Officer of


Encore Wire, and with me this morning are Vincent Rego, the Chairman of the Board, Frank Bilban


our Chief Financial Officer. Encore Wire and the building industry experienced a difficult first


quarter of 2005. The processing environment in our industry was highly competitive and resulted in


lower margins. The copper processes have been fairly volatile, which translated into cross-volatility


in the building wire market and margin erosion.


The mixed signals on processing have confused our distributor customer base to the point that


many of them are buying very cautiously and ordering only the minimum quantities possible. Our


plants ran very efficiently during the quarter, keeping costs low while we adjusted our production


schedules, and the recent capital expenditures we have made in our plants have enhanced our


manufacturing flexibility to produce our products, and we are adjusting inventory level to take


advantage of that flexibility.


Our general and administrative costs remain extremely low. We continue to focus on tight cost


controls throughout our operation, and we're pleased to recently report that we are earning the


armored cable market and will soon be breaking ground on new plant to manufacture that product


line.


This natural extension of our product line is a significant, long-term potential to grow and the sales


and earnings of Encore Wire. We continue to strive to improve margins in any way possible, and


we continue to resist gaining volume by cutting process and in focusing our customers' attention on


our innovative products and superior order fill rates. We believe there is room for significant growth


of Encore Wire sales and earnings in future. We're very proud of Encore's achievements and the


hard work our employees and associates put forth to make it happen. Frank Bilban, our Chief


Financial Officer, will now discuss our financial results. Frank?


Frank Bilban, CFO


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute I will review Encore's financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review, we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have already


received a copy of Encore's press release covering our financial results. This release is available


on the internet as well or you can call Doris Easterland or me at (800) 962-9473 and we will be glad


to get you a copy.


Before we begin, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the question-and-answer period


that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be forward-looking. In


order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to identify each


particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statements involve certain risks


and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. I

refer each of you to the company's SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed discussion


of these risks and uncertainties.


Now, the financials. Net sales in the first quarter of 2005 were $137.2 million versus $158.9 million


in the first quarter of 2004. Sales dollars decreased primarily due to lower volumes of product


shipped in 2005 versus 2004. Sales prices for wire rose 3% in the first quarter of '05 versus the


first quarter of '04, but did not keep pace with the cost of raw copper, which increased 23% in the


year-over-year comparison, dramatically compressing gross margins.


Net income in the first quarter of 2005 was $1 million compared to $13.3 million in the first quarter


of 2004. Fully diluted net income per share was 4 cents in the first quarter of 2005 compared to 56


cents in the same period of 2004. Results for the first quarter of 2005 include and adjustment to


reduce deferred tax liabilities by approximately $800,000, which was finalized by the company in its


tax provision review. This adjustment increased net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005


by $800,000 or 3 cents a share.


Our outstanding debt balance increased by $16.2 million in the quarter driven by a working capital


increase of $17.3 million and capital expenditures of $2.6 million. Our debt balance remains


conservative with most of our revolver availability untapped, and our interest cost is low. We also


want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion of


this session. Anyone wishing to hear this taped replay should call (866) 206-0194 and enter the


conference ID number 152944 and the pound sign. I'll now turn the floor over to Daniel Jones, our


President and Chief Operating Officer. Daniel?


Daniel Jones, President and COO


Thank you. As Frank highlighted, Encore posted a profit in a very difficult environment. We believe


we are well positioned for the future. Mr. Rego, do you have anything you want to add?


Vincent Rego, Chairman of the Board and CEO


Not at this time, no.


Daniel Jones, President and COO


Tara, I think we're ready for the question-and-answer session.
