including stock and stock option based compensation, amortization and impairment of intangible


assets and goodwill related to the company’s acquisitions, gains or losses on the sale of product


lines and related note receivable, and non-cash based income tax expense provide meaningful


supplemental information to both management and investors.


The non-GAAP financial analysis reflects the company’s core results and facilitates comparisons


across reporting periods. For more information on our non-GAAP financial results and reconciliation


to GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings release that has been filed under Form 8-K with


the SEC. The release can also be found on our website www.pctel.com under Investor Relations.


My discussion of results will be based on our non-GAAP financial results.


So, let’s turn to revenue. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue was $18.6 million. This compares to $14.8


million in the fourth quarter of ‘09, an increase of 26%. The improved sales reflected significantly


stronger volume in our targeted vertical markets for antenna products.


Antenna sales improved to both our large distributors and to OEM equipment providers. Scanning


receiver revenue saw a significant increase in sales to its value added resellers such as Ascom,


Anite, and SwissQual. For the year revenue was $69.3 million up 24% from ‘09. The general theme


of success in targeting vertical markets for antenna products and a general recovery in wireless test


and measurements spending levels were the primary drivers of the revenue increase for the year.


Now, let’s turn to gross profit margin. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was


47%, unchanged from the same period in ‘09. For the year gross profit was 45%, down two points


from 2009. Both Antenna and Scanning product revenues increased year-over-year. However,


Antenna product revenue, with its lower margins relative to scanning products increased at twice


the rate of scanning revenue accounting for the difference.


Now, let’s turn to Non-GAAP operating expenses which were $6.9 million in the quarter, an


increase of $500,000 from the same period last year. R&D decreased approximately $100,000


related to completion of several investments in scanning receiver development. Sales and


marketing was up approximately $700,000 due to the acquisition of Sparco in January 2010, an


increase in commissions in variable compensation related to the increase in revenue and the


company’s investment in vertical market sales activities. G&A is down approximately a $100,000


from the efficiencies gained from the company’s realignment to a functional organizational structure


early in 2010.


For the year, non-GAAP operating expense was $27.9 million, up approximately $2.8 million over


‘09. R&D was up a $1.0 million, attributed to two programs that have been completed. That is the


integration of the Ascom scanning receiver product line acquired in 2009, and the launch of the


company’s MX scanning receiver platform. Sales and marketing was up $1.9 million, attributed to


the acquisition Sparco in January 2010, an increase in commissions in variable comp related to the


increase in revenue, and the company’s investments in vertical market sales activities. G&A was


down a $100,000 on the year.


Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.9 million or 10% of revenue, compared to


$630,000 or 4% of revenue in the same period in ‘09. For the year, operating profit was $3.6 million


or 5% compared to $1.8 million or 3% last year. The increase in dollars and percent of revenue for


both the quarter and the year is reflective of higher gross margin on higher revenue, partially offset


by higher operating costs.


Now, let’s turn to other income, non-GAAP other income was $83,000 in the fourth quarter versus a


$177,000 in the same period last year. For the year, it was approximately $400,000 down $500,000


from 2009. The annual decrease from 2009 is about $200,000 from lower interest rates on the


company’s investments and 2009 contained a $300,000 gain from the liquidation of investment in


Columbia Strategic Asset Fund.
