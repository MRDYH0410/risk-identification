MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Welcome to Vector Group’s Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Before the


call begins, I’d like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call which are not historical facts are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in, or implied by, forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.


Now I’d like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group, Howard


Lorber.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s third quarter 2009 earnings


conference call. With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of Liggett Vector Brands


and Liggett, and Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group’s Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, I will


provide an update on our business and review Vector Group’s financials for the third quarter and


first nine months of 2009. Ron will then discuss the performance of Liggett Group and Vector


Tobacco for the periods and provide his perspective on industry developments and the competitive


environment. After that, we will take your questions.


Let me begin by saying that I cannot be more pleased with our company’s overall performance for


the first three quarters of 2009. In the face of significant Tobacco industry challenges, largely


created by the April 1, 2009 federal excise tax increase of $6.17 per carton. Our conventional


tobacco business has managed to provide solid earnings, while significantly outperforming the


industry from a volume perspective. Ron will discuss this in more detail shortly.


I’m also pleased to report that we are seeing positive signs in a still challenging real estate market.


We believe that there is substantial upside in many areas of the marketplace for those with the


conviction and where we’re called to act.


Before discussing the financial results, as noted on our previous call during the third quarter, we


further enhanced our strong financial position by completing the private placement of $85 million of


our 11% senior secured notes through 2015. This followed second quarter issuance of 50 million of


convertible notes to an affiliate of Dr. Phillip Frost, one of our country’s most successful


entrepreneurs, and the exchange of approximately $100 million of convertible notes.


In connection with the convertible debt transactions, we recognized a pre-tax non-cash charge on


extinguishment of debt of approximately 18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,


2009. In addition, due primarily to the narrowing of credit spreads in both the U.S. corporate credit


markets, and the market of the company’s debt in 2009, we recognized pre-tax non-cash charges


related to increases in the fair value of derivatives embedded within our convertible debt of 6.1


million and 25.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009.


Our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of approximately 237.5 million, as of


September 30, 2009. In addition, as of September 30, 2009 we held investment securities and


partnership interest with a fair market value of approximately 132.1 million.


Now let’s turn to the key financials for the three months and nine months ended September 30,


2009 for Vector Group. In addition to the non-cash charges related to our convertible debt


discussed above, our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 include a


pre-tax gain of $5 million related to the 1999 trademark transaction with Philip Morris. The

recognition of a 6.1 million deferred tax asset associates with Vector Tobacco state net operating


loss carry-forwards, pre-tax impairment charges of 8.5 million on real estate and pre-tax


restructuring charges of 1 million.


Our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2008 include $522,000 in gains


from the fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt and pre-tax impairment charges


of $7 million on real estate. Our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2008


include 12 million of pre-tax income from the St. Regis Hotel, 7.8 million in gains from the fair value


of derivatives embedded within convertible debt and pre-tax impairment charges of $7 million on


real estate.


For the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, Vector Group revenues were 236.7 million


compared to 145.6 million in the 2008 third quarter. The company reported operating income of 37


million in the 2009 third quarter, compared to operating income of 37.5 million in the 2008 third


quarter.


Third quarter 2009 net income was 16.2 million or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to 14.8 million


or $0.20 per diluted share in the 2008 period. Adjusting for the one-time tax benefit in 2009 and the


non-cash charges to the company’s convertible debt previously discussed, third quarter 2009 net


income was 13.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the impairment charges and


charges to the company’s convertible debt previously discussed, third quarter 2008 net income was


18.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share.


For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, Vector Group revenues were 564.7 million,


compared to 420.8 million in the first nine months of 2008. The company reported operating


income of 107 million in the 2009 period, compared to operating income of 99.9 million for the 2008


period.


Net income was 11.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to 48.3 million or $0.60 per


diluted share in the year ago period. Excluding the non-cash charges related to the company’s


convertible debt previously discussed, the gain on the trademark transaction, the one-time tax


benefit and the impairment losses and restructuring charges in the 2009 period; the company’s net


income for the first nine months of 2009 was 34.2 million or $0.40 – $0.47 per diluted share.


Excluding the income from the St. Regis Hotel, the impairment charges in 2008 and the non-cash


gains related to the company’s convertible debt previously discussed, the company’s net income for


the first nine months of 2008 was 40.7 million or $0.56 per share. The decline in pro forma income


for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 was primarily attributable to the affects of


the increase in excise taxes, increased net interest expense and a decline in income from non-


consolidated real estate businesses.


Now, I will turn the call over to Ron Bernstein for review of our Tobacco subsidiaries. Ron?


Ronald J. Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Liggett Group LLC and Liggett


Vector Brands Inc.


Thanks, Howard. Good morning to everybody. As Howard noted, we feel very good about our


performance during the first three quarters of 2009. As anticipated the largest federal excise tax


will be increased on Tobacco in history has had an impact on Liggett’s and rest of the industry this


year, and we expect it to continue to do so going forward.


However, entering 2009, we were well aware of the inevitability of the excise tax increase and had


developed the specific plans to position Liggett Vector Brands to perform well in this more


challenging environment. This plan involved maintaining strict focus on the efficiency of our
