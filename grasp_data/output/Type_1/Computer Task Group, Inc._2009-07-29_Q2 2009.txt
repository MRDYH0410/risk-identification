MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for standing by, welcome to the CTG Second Quarter


Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will


conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator


Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.


I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chief Executive Officer, James Boldt.


Please go ahead.


Deborah Pawlowski, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kei Advisors LLC


Lynda , this is Debbie Pawlowski, Investor Relations for CTG. Let me start with welcoming


everybody on the call today. We do have Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt; and Brendan


Harrington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Brendan are going to review


the results for the second quarter of 2009 and update you on the company’s strategy and outlook.


We’ll follow with an opportunity for questions and answers. If you don’t have the news release


discussing our financial results, you can access it at the company’s website at www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I do want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that


state the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and predictions for


the future are forward-looking statements. And it’s important to note that the company’s actual


results could differ materially from those projected. Additional information concerning factors that


could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our


earnings release, as well as in the company’s SEC filings. You can find these at our website or at


the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. So please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction


with these precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Debbie and good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us


this morning for our second quarter earnings conference call. As you saw in our earnings release,


while we were at the low end of our guidance for revenue, we’re pleased that once again we were


at the high end of our guidance for earning per share. Expanded margins from new solutions


projects, combined with quick and aggressive cost management to mitigate the current economic


environment’s impact on our earnings.


I’m going to talk more about our business and what we see for the rest of the year. But first, I’m


going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice


President


Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2009, CTG’s revenue was down


29% to 66.6 million, a decrease of 27.5 million compared with the second quarter of 2008.


Operating income was 2.4 million, a decrease of 1.6 million or a 39%.


Operating margin decreased to 3.6% of revenue, a 60 basis point decline from last year’s 4.2%,


which was our highest operating margin in almost 10 years.

Net income was 1.4 million in the quarter, a decline of 32% from 2.1 million in the second quarter of


2008. On a per diluted share basis, net income was $0.09 for the quarter, a 31% decrease over last


year.


Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2009 was 35% of total revenue, or 23.1 million. This


represents a 28% decline from last year’s second quarter. Jim will provide more detail on this item


in his remarks.


Staffing revenue was down 30% to 43.5 million of total revenue. Second quarter revenue from IBM,


our largest staffing customer, was 17.1 million compared with 29.3 million in the second quarter of


2008. As a percentage of total revenue, IBM was down to 25.7% in the 2009 second quarter


compared with 31.2% of total revenue in the second quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was 15.1 million, a 30% decrease from the 21.4 million


reported in last year’s second quarter. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, European revenue


in the quarter would have decreased by 19% over last year. Direct costs as a percentage of


revenue were 77.6% in the second quarter compared with 77% in the second quarter of 2008 and


77.6% in the first quarter of 2009.


Both the 2009 and 2008 second quarter’s results include equity compensation expense of


approximately $0.01 per diluted share, net of tax. The tax rate for the 2009 second quarter was


42% compared with 48% in the 2008 second quarter.


We expect the tax rate for the full year 2009 to continue to be between 41 and 43%. We had


approximately 2,700 employees at the end of the second quarter 2009, of which approximately


88% are billable resources. On the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding was 58 days


compared with 58 days at the end of the first quarter 2009 and with 59 days at the end of the


second quarter 2008.


Our cash provided by operations in the second quarter was approximately 6.8 million, as compared


with cash used in operations of 0.3 million in the second quarter 2008. We had 692,000 in capital


expenditures in the quarter, focused mostly on solutions development and we’ve recorded


depreciation expense of 420,000 in the quarter.


CTG’s financial position remains very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 14.7


million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt outstanding on our $35 million revolving credit


agreement, which is in place through April 2011.


During the second quarter of 2009, while adhering to SEC imposed volume limitations, we


repurchased approximately 213,000 shares of CTG common stock. During this most recent self-


imposed blackout period, prior to releasing earnings, we repurchased shares under our 10b5-1


plan. As of July 3, 2009, our repurchase authorization is for approximately 900,000 shares.


We believe CTG’s shares remain undervalued at recent prices, and we intend to continue our


repurchase program through the remainder of 2009. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks, Brendan. In aggregate, our solutions business declined by 28% in the second quarter of


2009. As we’ve reported on previous calls, the tight credit markets have negatively impacted


demand for our solutions business, particularly demand from the healthcare provider market. Not-


for-profit hospitals finance a significant portion of their needs through the issuance of tax-exempt


bonds. Due to the credit crunch and rating downgrades, these hospitals are not currently able to
