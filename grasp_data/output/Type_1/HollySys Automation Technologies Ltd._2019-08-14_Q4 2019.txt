Within high-end coal fire market, we signed contracts to provide DEH to Guohua Jinjie 2*660 megawatt and Huaneng Shengli 2*660 megawatt power stations. Despite slowdown in coal fire, we continued to explore opportunities in new energy, and managed to maintain our leading position, especially in garbage power. In the chemical and petrochemical industry, we have optimized our team to facilitate market penetration and comprehensive solution offering in different sub-verticals. Meanwhile, our milestone Zhong'an coal-chemical project is approaching its completion. We provided a total over 60,000 (sic) [70,000] (00:06:37) DCS control points and the execution of the project last for more than two years.

Our capability has been highly praised by our client and we believe this project will help build up our reputation as a competitive solution provider for large-size projects and high-end clients in the industry. The momentum of the after-sales service continued, driven by the demand from rebuilding and upgrade. We are also improving international coordination – internal coordinator when connecting with our customer base.

[Foreign Language] (00:23:27-00:23:37)

Operator, please.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from the line of Alex Chang. Your line is now open.

The first person question is about the fourth quarter, the gross margin compared decrease, and – but we could see the IA or Rail business the revenue side are increasing, but relative the integrated contract, the compared decrease either. So, how we can understand about the gross margin and the [ph] integrated (00:25:27) contract gross margin?

The second question about goodwill impairment and which company impact the goodwill impairment. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:25:40-00:26:23)

The first question about the gross margin, the integrated contract compared decrease, this is also including the influence by the international companies [ph] spin off (00:26:35). And – but the main gross margin for the whole company, this come from the revenue translation, the particular – some particular project, the gross margin [ph] registered (00:26:47) lower, so this lead to the quarterly fluctuation, but for the whole fiscal year to see the gross margin still within the stable range.

[Foreign Language] (00:27:00-00:27:05)

The second question about goodwill impairment, all come from the Concord company.

The second question is about the goodwill impairment right now, we could see still have $37 million on hand and could you help us to distinguish what kind of company is inside of the goodwill?

[Foreign Language] (00:27:46-00:27:53)

The $37 million goodwill or I mean, they may come from the [ph] bond of (00:28:02) the company.

[Foreign Language] (00:28:05-00:28:16)

[Foreign Language] (00:28:21)

And in the past years, the goodwill impairment all came from the Concord. And right now, each year, we do the testing for the goodwill impairment. But right now, the bond is still very stable and no such issue, but we will continue to the testing each year.

Thank you. Operator, the next one, please.

Thank you. The next question we have is from the line of Jacqueline Du from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

The first question is about the service revenue compared increased very fast, but – and also from – could you give us our separate proportion for each business, i.e. Rail and M&E sector, and what about the service proportion for each segment?

And the second question about Industrial Automation. The coal fire is slowing down, but we could see the new energy garbage power is increasing. But I do want to know about the IA total revenue breaking down for each industry proportion.

And the third one is about the Railway Transportation, from the calendar year to see the rolling of stocks deal no any procurement right now. And what about the [ph] Hollysys (00:31:51) stock for the whole calendar year about the procurement of the rolling stock relate to ATP contracts?

[Foreign Language] (00:32:18-00:33:12)

Okay. The first question about the service, we do not disclose the breaking out number for each segment but the whole after-sale revenue including service right now around the 20% of total revenue. This is compared increasing all the time. And one thing I want to make clarify is about this fiscal year, we started to use the ASC 606 and this is well influenced the service contract, recognized revenue matter and we change to use the POC this time. So, this is also compared a little affecting the service revenue recognition. And that is to say it should be higher than the current number. But because of the ASC 606, we're going to last for based on the whole period of the contract.

And the second one for the IA proportion and currently the petrochemical and chemical take around the 40% to 45% of total IA revenue and that the power take [ph] 30% (00:34:35) to 45% and the others about 10% to 15%, and 5% from the nuclear power.

[Foreign Language] (00:34:44-00:35:07)

And for the Railway Transportation new contract, for this calendar year, we get from -- mainly from the online [ph] round (00:35:18) equipment and – from the truck side and also the service contract. But the ATP relate to rolling stock, this part has no any information right now. And then most probably, by the CRC, they will do the procurement at the end of the calendar year, so we can the future.

[Foreign Language] (00:35:44). Xie xie.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Operator, next one, please.

The next question we have – thank you. The next question we have is from the line of Alex Chang from Citi. Your line is now open.

The question is about the subway information, we not hear more about the subway sector update. So, is there any changing for the [indiscernible] (00:36:33) planning or what else?

[Foreign Language] (00:36:43-00:36:52)

The subway business deal steady at Q4. So we have no any strategic changing for this part.

Okay, Alex, do you have more questions?

[Foreign Language] (00:37:18). Xie xie. Xie xie.

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you.

Okay.

Sorry. Please go ahead.

Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise your questions we will be pleased to answer them from the follow-up contacts. We're looking forward – okay.

Hold on a second. Maybe we still have a question, right, operator?

Yes. The next question we have is from the line of Kevin Li from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

The first question is about the fiscal year 2020 from the management [indiscernible] (00:39:26) perspective to say what about the new product – what kind of new product that we could provide to the market and what about the influence about a new product to contribute to the revenue? And the second question about the Railway Transportation. Could you please to distinguish about the backlog? What kind of proportion for the ATP and the maintenance and TCC?

[Foreign Language] (00:40:06-00:40:47)

From the new product, we concentrate for strengthen our intellectual smarts and also all these things industrial [indiscernible] (00:41:01) investment. This is including the management diagnosis and also including the prediction for equipment including the hardware and software. And [indiscernible] (00:41:15) like the Industrial Automation sector, we are implementing the product for [indiscernible] (00:41:21) the power plant. This is intellectual smart plant. And when it's finished, it could set a good representation for the customers. And also the Railway Transportation sector, the subway, we also use the intellectual information management. This all come from when we dedicated the software, hardware platform.

And these products, no matter the IA or Rail, currently not take a very large proportion of the revenue. But it will bring a very strong impact in the future.

[Foreign Language] (00:42:06-00:42:21)

And beyond that, we also already constructed a team for the industrial information security and we will provide the new products in future and also a future at this part also gathered revenue from the service and products.

[Foreign Language] (00:42:47-00:43:08)

The Railway Transportation backlog, we have no breakdown number to provide, but I can give you some sense about the ATP contract that relatively compare a large percentage than the TCC on the railway track, and also the subway and the maintenance contract still are normal. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:43:38).

Due to the time constraint, we will now take one last question from the queue. Operator, please.

Your last question comes from the line of [ph] Joseph Qui (00:43:50) from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.

[Foreign Language] (00:43:55-00:44:02)

The first part is about the – for the fiscal year 2020, do you have any guidance for the top line and bottom line? The second question about the IA, what about the expectation for the future proposing changing?

[Foreign Language] (00:44:50-00:45:27)

The first question about the guidance. Currently, we still have no guidance. But for the coming 2020 fiscal year, we have confident to keep the growth. And that if in future we think the situation are getting material, we will give the update for the guidance.

And the second question about the proportion. The proportion in recent years have no – very stable, have no fluctuate changing. But we will focus from another [indiscernible] (00:46:06) say, we will focus the energy saving, environmental protection and also the intellectual smart industrial automation work. So, this part, we believe in future will bring a strong momentum.

[Foreign Language] (00:46:27).

Thank you, [ph] Joseph (00:46:27).
