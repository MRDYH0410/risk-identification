MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the Encore Wire fourth quarter earnings conference call.


As a reminder all lines will be only on a listen-only mode, then we will conduct a Q&A session at the


end of the call. [Operator Instructions].


At this time I would like to turn the call over to Daniel Jones, President of Encore Wire so that we


may begin the call. Going ahead, Daniel.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Meiko, and thank you, folks, for joining us this morning. I am Daniel Jones, the


President and CEO of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our CFO.


The past five quarters had proved to be very challenging for the building wire industry; in the fourth


quarter of 2007 these conditions adversely impacted Encore, resulting in only the second quarterly


loss this company has reported since 1995. Certain competitors continue to respond to the


slowdown in residential construction by cutting wire prices in an attempt to maintain budgeted


production schedules, compressing margins below our expectations at this level of COMEX prices.


Our unit volume shipped in the full-year 2007 held up fairly well, despite the slowdown in residential


construction. However, we sacrificed unit volume repeatedly in 2007 as we attempted to avoid low


prices to obtain volume. This was particularly true in October of 2007, which began with strong


COMEX copper prices of 375 per pound. We had low unit sales volume in October, which is


historically one of the stronger months of the year, due to our efforts to introduce and support price


increases.


We purchased quantities of copper in October that exceeded our sales volume at the October


average COMEX price of 359 a pound, this turned out to be problematic as the industry chose not


to match our attempted price increases and copper prices fell precipitously in November and


December with COMEX average prices of 313 and 302, respectively. With this volatility in copper,


we were forced to reluctantly match our competitors’ pricing in November and December, selling


the remaining high priced October copper in the next months.


While we are disappointed with our fourth quarter loss, it must be viewed in the context of the


current industry environment. Our staff has done a remarkable job to enable us to perform as well


as we have, exemplified by our high order fill rates, innovative products and low-cost structure. We


have an excellent group of independent representatives selling our products through which we


have developed lasting customer relationships.


All of these attributes contributed to the many positive achievements we had in 2007. With our


exceptionally strong balance sheet, we had the capability to approach the future confidently, while


our short-term focus is one of riding out the storm. Our low-cost structure and strong balance sheet


have enabled us to withstand tough periods in the past. We believe we’ll emerge stronger when


market conditions improve.


We would like to thank our employees and associates for their tremendous efforts and our


shareholders for their continued support in the challenging times.


Frank Bilban, our CFO, will now discuss our financial results. Frank?

Frank J. Bilban, Vice President-Finance, Treasurer, and Secretary


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter. After the


financial review we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have received a copy


of Encore’s press release covering Encore’s financial results. This release is available on the


Internet or you can call Denise Liss or me at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.


Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in our initial comments and in the Q&A period


that follows we may make certain statements that might be considered to be forward-looking. In


order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to identify each


particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statement involves certain risks


and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. I


refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases for a more detailed discussion


of these risks and uncertainties.


Now for the financial results. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were 1.185 billion


compared to 1.249 billion during 2006. Lower prices for building wire sold in 2007 accounted for the


decrease in net sales dollars versus 2006. Unit volume in 2007 increased 1% over 2006. Net


income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $30.8 million versus $115.1 million in 2006.


Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $1.30 for the year ended December 2007 versus


$4.86 in 2006.


Net sales for the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2007 were $281.9 million


compared to $262.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2006. Unit sales in the fourth quarter of


2007 increased 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2006. However, intense competitive pricing


pressure compressed gross margins to the lowest levels in the history of the company. Net income


for the fourth quarter of 2007 was a loss of $1.1 million versus a $6.2 million profit in the fourth


quarter of 2006. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were a loss of $0.05 in the fourth


quarter of 2007 versus a profit of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2006.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $281.9 million


versus $308.5 million during the third quarter of 2007. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007


was a loss of 1.1 million versus the profit of 5.8 million we enjoyed in the third quarter of 2007. Fully


diluted net income per common share was a loss of $0.05 in the fourth quarter of ‘07 versus a profit


of $0.24 in the third quarter of ‘07.


The only long-term debt we have as of December 31, 2007 is $100 million in long-term notes due in


2011, with our $200 million revolving line of credit paid down to zero. In addition, we have $78.9


million in cash as of December 31, 2007. Our balance sheet has a conservative 28.2% debt-to-


equity ratio. If you deduct cash balance from our debt resulting in a net debt of $21.1 million, our


net debt-to-equity ratio is 5.9%. Due to the lower debt levels in 2007, we were able to cut our net


interest cost by over $3.6 million versus 2006, a decrease of 47%. Our capital expenditures for


2007 totaled $28.5 million. Pursuant to the stock repurchase plan we announced in November of


‘07, we repurchased 177,300 shares of our stock through January; 124,400 of these shares were


repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2007.


We also declared our fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend during the fourth quarter of 2007.


We would like everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the


conclusion of this session. If you wish to hear the taped replay, dial 866-439-4729 and enter the


conference reference number 351380 and the pound sign.


I will now turn the floor back over to Daniel Jones, our President and Chief Executive Officer.


Daniel?
