Thank you, Arden, and greeting to everyone. I would like to discuss some key events during this quarter. Revenue and the new contract just from our IA business for the quarter stayed at $49.5 million and $43.9 million, representing a 14.2% and 4.1% year-over-year decrease respectively. From a half year representing, revenue and contract represent a 6.9% year-over-year decrease and 4.5% year-over-year increase, respectively. Despite the macroeconomic headwind, management believes that our IA business remains on a healthy path and several highlights are worth mentioning.

We kept our leadership in power and devoted adequate resource in chemical and petrochemical for expansion, while maintaining our involvement in various other industries. In power, despite a slowdown in coal fire construction, steadily performance in thermal power and new energy, as well as after-sale services have been stabilizing factors for our power business that would not be ignored.

We kept addressing our valuable customers based on responses to various services demand. The communication with our customers have been fruitful and constructive, evidenced by the steady after sales growth. Beyond that, we are also actively building our matrix of intelligent solution that help bring our customers towards the next era of manufacturing. Our efforts are well rewarded and our value-added solution on equipment management, control optimization, and information security, et cetera were accepted by more customers.

Furthermore, we are proud to announce our first intelligent plant solution in the power industry with Liaoning Diaobingshan Power Company. With the full-scale data integration as the key, it's the solution will help realize greater visibility on equipment consumption, greater operational flexibility in power unit until and will ultimately improve the efficiency and the management. With this milestone, we will continue to leverage the know-how we have accumulated and join hands with more customers from various industries to reshape their way of manufacturing.

Quarterly revenue and the new contract for our railway business were $63.5 million and $173.1 million, representing an 8.7% year-over-year decrease and 20.4% year-over-year increase, respectively. From a half year perspective, revenue and the new contract recorded an 8.7% and 61.8% year-to-year increase, respectively. In high-speed rail, we signed 98 sets of C3 ATP from quarter along with the numerous advanced and heavy maintenance contracts. We also signed a track circuit contract for the regular speed freight railway from Jingbian to Shenmu, Shaanxi Province, China. In subway business, milestone was achieved as we provided our first SCADA + Integrated Cloud Platform solution to Hohhot subway line 1 and line 2, as well as Shenzhen Subway Line 6. We see this as an effective addition to our subway business as we kept executing the steady expansion strategy.

For high-speed rail business, calendar 2018 (sic) [2019] (00:08:24) is expected to be a busy year as 13th Five Year Plan period is entering its final two years. Going forward into the future and given a visible long-term railway construction plan, we will continue to adhere to the diversity strategy for stable and healthy growth to improve our local service network for more value-added and differentiated service, and we kept leveraging our strong R&D capacity for the preparation of next generation railway technology.

In overseas business, M&E recorded a quarterly revenue and new contract of $36.5 million and $36.5 million, representing a 20.8% and 20.1% year-over-year increase respectively. From a half year perspective, revenue and new contract recorded a 26.6% and 23.3% year-over-year increase respectively. Measures taken to improve the operations have brought constant benefit to the M&E business, while geopolitical issues in Middle East and as well as the macro economy in Southeast Asia remained to be watched.

In our IA overseas business, we continued to work with major domestic SOEs on EPC projects while at the same time, contributed adequate effort to expand our partnership. We took one step further in the localization of our business as the construction of our India assembly and testing plant was completed. With this, we have set a foothold for improved response time to our overseas customers. Going forward, we expect increasing level of coordination to be built between our overseas and domestic business.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steven Wang, who will lead the financial results analysis.

Thank you, Mr. Shao. I'd like to share some financial highlights for the second quarter and the first half year ended December 31, 2018. Comparing to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, the total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 decreased from $157.4 million to $149.5 million, representing a decrease of 5%.

Integrated contract revenue decreased by 13.2% to $116.7 million, products sales revenue decreased by 39.1% to $5.9 million, and services revenue increased by 102.5% to $26.9 million. The company's total revenues can be presented in segments as follows. For the three months ended December 31, 2018 industrial automation revenue, $49.5 million; rail transportation automation revenue, $63.5 million; mechanical and electrical solution revenue, $36.5 million. Total revenue from the second quarter, $149.5 million.

For the six months ended December 31, 2018, industrial automation revenue, $107.2 million; rail transportation automation revenue, $113.9 million; mechanical and electrical solution revenue, $67.1 million. Total revenues for the first half of the fiscal year $288.2 million. Overall non-GAAP gross margin was 38.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 39.4% for the same period of prior year.

The non-GAAP gross margin for integrated contracts, product sales, and services were 30.8%, 72% and 62.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 34.5%, 67.4% and 68.6% for the same period of the prior year, respectively. The gross margin fluctuation was mainly due to the different revenue mix with different margins.

Selling expenses were $7.9 million for second quarter, an increase of $0.2 million or 1.6% compared to the $7.7 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Presented as a percentage of total revenues, selling expenses were 5.3% and 4.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Presented as a percentage of total revenues, R&D expenses were 7% and 6.7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The VAT refunds and government subsidies were $14.8 million for the second quarter, as compared to $9.4 million for the same period in the prior year, representing a $5.4 million or 57.1% increase, which was primarily due to increase of VAT refunds.

Income tax expenses and effective tax rate were $6.3 million and 12.5% for the second quarter, as compared to $9.3 million and 20.4% for comparable prior year period. The effective tax rate fluctuation was mainly due to the different pre-tax income mix with different tax rates, as company's subsidiaries are subject to different tax rates in various jurisdictions.

The non-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys was $44.3 million or $0.73 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2018.

At this time, we'd like to open up for Q&A session. Please note that the Chinese speaking participants, we can also do the Q&A in Mandarin, and we'll provide translation.

[Foreign Language] (00:19:20-00:19:31)

Operator, please.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Thomas Zhang from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

[Foreign Language] (00:20:13-00:20:18).

[Foreign Language] (00:20:18-00:20:19).

[Foreign Language] (00:20:20-00:21:51)?

Okay. Let me translate the questions. The first question is about, for the change order [indiscernible] (00:21:58) new order, the revenue compare decreased and also the backlog compare, the history also at a low base, what about the expectation in future about the IA revenue and the new order health of backlogs?

The second question about the VAT refund, so why is this quarter is compared so high than the prior fiscal year?

The third question is about the railway transportation new order. This quarter, we could see compare increased about $117 million. So, can you give me a breakdown number about what's inside? We know about the – from the announcement before the TCC plus ATP contract announcement around $15 million. So, what about the others, including waiting the $117 million? And also, we know about ATP [indiscernible] (00:23:07) about 98 sets of the contract at the first half fiscal year 2019 year, but what else? Also, give me more detail about the contract, the breakdown number?

[Foreign Language] (00:23:27-00:24:30).

About the Industrial Automation, compare decreased beyond the microeconomic slowing down. Internally from our company side, there are different reasons. One element is about the consolidated financials. Compared to the quarter, the prior year, we have our intelligence company and spinoff compared this quarter.

So, this is an influence. Second is about the nuclear business. And also, last – after fiscal year, the same quarter revenue and the contract are both higher than this quarter of fiscal year 2019. And also, the [indiscernible] (00:25:24) rate has some influence. So, these stocks account for the decrease [indiscernible] (00:25:32) IA actually eliminated these factors. The IA for the [indiscernible] (00:25:41) the new order should compare increase and also – but the revenue compare decreased, it's just made from those reasons. But, in future, I mean, the hope is [indiscernible] (00:25:59) see we still have confidence that is should compare positive growth for the IA.

[Foreign Language] (00:26:09-00:27:01).

About the VAT refund, actually, [indiscernible] (00:27:06) the fluctuation, but for the yearly basis, it should be steady compared to the prior year. So, it really depends on when we get the money from the bureau – tax bureau. And, another one I want to add a supplement is about the backlog for the whole company.

Actually, still have actual change about – according to ASC 606 we adopted from July 1, 2018. So, that also influenced the backlog around [indiscernible] (00:27:54) million. So, that is also another reason for the backlog compare up – in a low base in the history. Thank you.

[Foreign Language] (00:28:12-00:29:41)?

About the railway transportation new order, beyond the TCC/ATP you said that offset $10 million, what else? The others, we not did give the specific number, but this is also including the subway contract, and also including like the [indiscernible] (00:30:02) the high-speed rail. And – but, the general speaking for the whole railway transportation, we – in our shorter term, the national railway investment in 2019 is expected to be [indiscernible] (00:30:22_ year 2018, well stronger than the year before. A longer term national railway network funding indicates a vision for a high-speed rail that cover around for 45,000 kilometers as of now, less than 65% have been achieved. So, more constructions are expected in the long-term.

[Foreign Language] (00:30:53-00:31:39)?

I have the supplement question about track circuit, what about the current execution condition, including the contract signed and also the revenue recognition?

Second question about the Industrial Automation, you said several factors that capital has declined, one is the exchange rate, and also how the [indiscernible] (00:32:15) also how the nuclear. So, I want to confirm if excluding these factors, actually, the second quarter new contractors should compare increase, is that right?

And the third question is about the [indiscernible] (00:32:34). So, how much about those contract influence?

[Foreign Language] (00:32:49-00:33:24)

The first question, actually the track circuit, we did not disclose the number exactly, but I can tell you about the current execution contract including two projects. One is the regular speed tract circuit. This is not a too large contract. It's just like [indiscernible] (00:33:45) level, but the high-speed rail – another project is high-speed rail, but [indiscernible] (00:33:54) also not a very large contract signed. The purpose is to, when we are finished for this kind of year, we can apply for the license to participate in the high-speed rail track circuit bidding.

[Foreign Language] (00:34:12-00:35:02)?

The next question is about the [indiscernible] (00:35:04). Actually, we already disclosed in July, I mean last calendar year 2018. So, that part we invested into the [indiscernible] (00:35:24) company, and this part right now performance, I mean, the [indiscernible] (00:35:29) company performance is steady and is excluding this element influence. Actually, yes, in this automation, no matter [indiscernible] (00:35:42) or half year results, new contract should compare increase.

[Foreign Language] (00:35:52-00:35:55).

Thank you. Operator, next one, please.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jacqueline Du from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, ma'am.

[Foreign Language] (00:36:09-00:36:50)?

I have two questions. One is, for the fiscal year 2019, I cannot see any guidance, so the half year already [indiscernible] (00:37:01) could you give us the guidance for the whole fiscal year?

The second question is about the P&L. We – the other income have $5.9 million. This is compare increase a lot. So, can you explain what is inside about this item?

[Foreign Language] (00:37:25-00:38:08).

Actually, at the beginning of this fiscal year, we did not give the guidance. So, during the time, we explained to the shareholders and institutional investors, actually, we focused about the – we are [indiscernible] (00:38:26) to support the business development and also the strategic thinking about – through operation or investment, a lot of the other activity to support our business.

From the number to say, we [indiscernible] (00:38:44) performance number. Actually, the whole fiscal year, we still have confidence to achieve compare increase.

[Foreign Language] (00:38:55-00:39:31).

The other income, the main reason high as compared to the other – in the history, the main reason is attribute our investment income when performing at that assessment for a new [indiscernible] (00:39:51) . We recognize additional value. So that also like what I mentioned the [ph] intelligent (00:39:58) company, when we spin off and we invested into the Ningbo company, and right now this [ph] part is again for the P&L (00:40:06). And right now everything goes through [indiscernible] (00:40:11) performance also good. And also this is the main reason. I mean also other income including the other small elements like the asset deal off and also the government relating to some activities. But the main reason is what I said.

[Foreign Language] (00:40:41-00:41:08)

Can you explain – I want to ask Mr. Shao, can you explain about what is your strategic thinking right now? You said, [ph] not in the (00:41:21) guidance. So can you talk more, give us more color about what you are doing about the direction for the business right now.

[Foreign Language] (00:41:32-00:43:58)

The [ph] campaign to power the three plus one plus n (00:44:01) strategy, the [ph] three plus one (00:44:05) refers to upgrading our three main business capability including industrial automation, railway transportation automation and medical automation. By introducing intelligent manufacture technology that covers industrial internet, industrial big data and artificial intelligence, such upgrade will enable us to offer more comprehensive solution and better infusion. And to boost the overall digitalization and the intelligence level of our business.

The [ph] one plus n (00:44:40) refers to developing an industrial internet platform, that is to open to enterprise client, publication developer, system integrator and platform operator. The platform will bring value to large, medium, and small enterprise in their cost of digitalization transformation to contribute to their formation of our sustainable industrial internet [ph] control system (00:45:14) and to realized greater manufacturing intelligence for the entire industry. To implement this strategy, we will improve the utilization of those internal and external resources. We have devoted resource to the construction of our intelligence manufacture, innovation center and to promote the upgrade and our entire business was greater digitalization and intelligence.

We are building our comprehensive solution matrix that covers equipment [indiscernible] (00:45:44) production management system and industrial Internet platforms. We are also bolster our capability [ph] through cycle (00:45:52) surveys for intelligence manufacture that covers planning, designing, infusion and operation with the industrial and infrastructure at the intended business area.

So, generally speaking another example also, we created – setup the Ningbo company, so this company also help Hollysys develop some basic platform products, so, can empower the whole Hollysys to develop our IA business. This is including the product [indiscernible] (00:46:27). I mean this [indiscernible] (00:46:30).

And so internally we want to [indiscernible] (00:46:38) development to improve our capability of the company industrial automation control. And also we want to provide more comprehensive solutions to the customers.

[Foreign Language] (00:46:54-00:47:22)

Okay. And also, we raised the big industrial automation concept. This is just what I said the whole capability into the industrial automation. So [ph] Thomson or Hangzhou (00:47:45) company, the current process, the mature process in the process control industry, they already have strong track record and also have sales channels. So, we want them to deliver to a customer the comprehensive solutions focused on the big industrial automation control concept. And through those other things can improve our operating efficiency.

[indiscernible] (00:48:24) So, by the time constraint we now take one last question from the queue. Operator, please.

The next question comes from the line of Fiona Fang from Citigroup. Your line is now open.

[Foreign Language] (00:48:52)

[Foreign Language] (00:48:54)

[Foreign Language] (00:48:55-00:49:51)

I have additional question, refers to that Mr. Shao [ph] showed in IA (00:49:58) like we have some new product for the intelligence plant and also in the railway transportation, we have the SCADA [ph] + (00:50:11) Integrated Cloud Platform solution to the subway. So [ph] can you introduce (00:50:16) more about these two projects? What's the difference compared [ph] before (00:50:22) project? And what about the gross margin for these two projects?

[Foreign Language] (00:50:30-00:53:20)

This question also can match what I've [ph] said about (00:53:27) the strategy. And actually, the IA, this project [indiscernible] (00:53:32) so it focused the coal fire plant. And right now along for the upgrading by the customer, we also provide the intelligent solutions. This including the basic control system, and also the intelligent management.

The differences compared before that we added a lot of new functions and matched [indiscernible] (00:54:01) like the prediction and also the maintenance. You don't have to shut down the whole factory and we can help you to predict the equipment status.

And also, about the data, before not used, but right now we use the data for the analyzing to predict the [ph] working technician (00:54:24) for the future 10 or 20 minutes, for example. So this can improve the efficiency of the customer.

And right now the project, these are demonstration projects. So the gross margin have no too much [ph] increasing (00:54:43). But in future, along when we setup the [ph] test record (00:54:49), we can show to the customer about the result to help them improve the efficiency. So we think will [ph] gradually lead (00:54:57) to value our gross margin.

And the subway, the project at SCADA, actually the platform, they integrated a lot of subsystems, like alarm system, power system. But right now also the same issue that they [ph] cannot – useful (00:55:19). So right now we add the platform, can collect the data into the cloud. And they will use the cloud to do the analyzing. And this is a lot of new demand and also value-adding [indiscernible] (00:55:37).

This is as – also the demonstration project. So the gross margin just – and not added more. It's just like [ph] a before (00:55:48) project. But as what I said, the impact is significant. In future along we provide more big solution, comprehensive solution to – dealing with the demand of the customer upgrading, and they will see the value what we provide. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you, everyone.

[indiscernible] (00:56:18) xie xie.

[Foreign Language] (00:56:22-00:57:12).

Okay. My question is about the – you said you provide a more value-adding services, but what about the contract and revenue [ph] reflect (00:57:26). Is this adding more?

The answer is for industrial automation, yes, because based on the [indiscernible] (00:57:36), we added more intelligent services and also including the data, the other platform. So the contract size is larger than [ph] before (00:57:47) and also the revenue, larger than [ph] before (00:57:51). But the subway factor, not like this. Subway factor because this value-adding services just start, so not add more value to the contract or the revenue.

Thank you.

Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you haven't got a chance to raise your question, we are pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We're looking forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you. Xie xie. [Foreign Language] (00:58:25)

That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect.
