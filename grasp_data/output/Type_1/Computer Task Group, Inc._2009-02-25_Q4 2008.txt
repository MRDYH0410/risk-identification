MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by Welcome to the CTG Fourth Quarter


and 2008 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we


will conduct a question-and-answer session instructions will be given at that time. [Operator


Instructions]. And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.


I would now like to turn the conference over to Debbie Pawlowski, Investor Relations for CTG.


Please go ahead.


Debbie Pawlowski, Investor Relations


Thank you, Mary and good morning everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your interest


in CTG. On the call today we have CTG’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Boldt; and Brendan


Harrington, Senior Vice President and CFO.


Jim and Brendan are going to review the results for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the year and


update you on the company’s strategy and outlook. We’ll follow with an opportunity for Q&A. If you


don’t have the news release discussing our financial results, you can access it at the company’s


website www.ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, and predictions for the


future are forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company’s actual results could


differ materially from those projected. Additional information [inaudible] of actual results to differ


from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings release, as well as in the


company’s SEC filings. You can find these at our website or the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.


Please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.


With that, I would like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussions. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer


Thanks Debbie and good morning everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this


morning for our fourth quarter earnings conference call. As you saw in our release, our earnings


once again exceeded our guidance, despite the fact that revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 was


below our expectations. High earnings from our solutions business and quick and aggressive cost


management more than offset the current economic environments impact on our staffing business.


I’m going to talk more about our business and what we see for 2009 and beyond, but first I’m going


to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan Harrington, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Jim. Good morning. For the fourth quarter of 2008, CTG reported significantly higher


profitability on a slight decline on revenue. Revenue was 83.3 million a decrease of 1.2 million or


1.4%, compared with fourth quarter of 2007. Operating income increased 75% in the quarter to 3.2


million largely as a result of the growth in our more profitable solutions offerings and favorable


operating leverage.


These factors also drove the year-over-year 170 basis point increase in our operating margin to


3.9% of revenue. Net income in the quarter grew 90% to 2.3 million from 1.2 million in the fourth

quarter of 2007. Net income per diluted share was $0.15 for the quarter, a 114% increase from last


year’s $0.07. Excluding a $0.03 gain from foreign currency exchange on inner subsidiary borrowing


net income per diluted share in the quarter would have been $0.12, a 71% increase compared with


fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to the improved operating margins.


Solutions revenue in the 2008 fourth quarter was $29.9 million or 36% of total revenue. This


represents 2.3% growth in our solutions revenue, compared with fourth quarter of 2007. We had


$23 million in revenue from IBM, our largest staffing customer in the quarter, compared with $25.4


million in the fourth quarter of 2007. This represents 27.6% and 30% of total revenue in the 2008


and 2007 fourth quarters respectively. Total staffing revenue was $53.4 million in the quarter.


Revenue from our European operations was $19.1 million in the fourth quarter, a 3.8% decrease


from the $19.8 million recorded in last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding foreign exchange


fluctuations, European revenues in the quarter would have increased by 6.4% over last year. On a


sequential basis had the U.S dollar remain unchanged during the 2008 fourth quarter, compared


with the exchange rates from the third quarter of 2008, our fourth quarter revenue would have been


2.7 million or 3.2% higher than our reported revenue. Direct cost with a percentage of revenue were


77.6% in the fourth quarter, compared with 77.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 78% in the third


quarter of 2008.


Both the 2008 and 2007 fourth quarter’s results include equity compensation expense of


approximately $0.01 per diluted share net of tax. The tax rate for both the 2008 and 2007 fourth


quarters was approximately 37%. The tax rate for the full year 2008 was approximately 41%, the


expected tax rate for the full year 2009 is between 40 and 42%. The company had approximately


3,100 employees at the end of the fourth quarter 2008 of which approximately 88% are billable


resources.


On the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding was 57 days compared with 58 days at the end


of 2007 and with 56 days at the end of the third quarter 2008. Our cash flow from operations in the


fourth quarter was approximately 4.9 million, as compared to $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of


2007. We had 620,000 in capital expenditures and we recorded depreciation expense of 465,000 in


the fourth quarter. CTG’s financial position remains very strong. At the end of the quarter we had no


debt outstanding on our $35 million revolving credit agreement that is in place through April 2011.


We had approximately 11 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2008. During the fourth


quarter 2008, while adhering to SEC-imposed volume limitations, we repurchased 444,000 shares


of CTG common stock. During this most recent self-imposed blackout period prior to releasing our


earnings, we repurchased shares under our 10b5-1 plan. As indicated by our board’s new one


million share repurchase authorization announced yesterday. We believe CTG’s shares remain


under valued at recent prices and we intending to continue our repurchase program through the


remainder of 2009. Jim?


James R. Boldt, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer


Thanks Brendan. As I mentioned the primary driver of the significant increase in our profitability in


the fourth quarter was our solutions business. Our new healthcare offerings are yielding a much


higher operating profit than our traditional solutions business. The higher operating margin on the


new healthcare offerings we introduced over the last year was one of the main drivers in the


improvement of our operating margin during the fourth quarter. The last two years, we have also


been working on several new healthcare offerings such as our solution to detect and reduce


medical fraud waste and abuse. We see this offering and others we expect to go commercial in


2009 as breakthrough solutions that bring a new and better approach to helping our healthcare


clients achieve strategic and operational objectives while lowing cost.
