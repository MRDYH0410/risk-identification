looking statements regarding OSG’s prospects including the outlook for tanker and articulated tug

Heidmar Lightering with OSG’s operations, estimated TCE rates achieved for the third and fourth


quarters of 2007, anticipated levels of new building and scrapping, projected dry-dock and repair


schedule, the prospects of OSG’s strategy of being a market leader in the segments in which it


competes, the projected growth of the world tanker fleet, and the forecast of world economic activity


and world oil demand.


Factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ from the expectations


reflected in these forward-looking statements are described in OSG’s annual report on Form 10-K


for 2006.For this conference call, we prepared and posted on OSG’s web site supporting slides to

Total TCE revenues increased 27% to 274 million in the quarter from 260 million a year ago. Crude


oil TCE revenues increased 10% to 160 million from 146 million. The addition of Heidmar Lightering


added 13.8 million to the current quarter TCE revenues.


And year-over-year, all crude oil tanker processes achieved stronger rates. Crude, as a percentage


of TCE, declined to 59% from 67% a year ago, a notable and intended decline and a result of our


expansion in the US segment last year.


Products TCE was up 20% to 59 million, representing 22% of total TCE.


US Flag TCE revenue was 49 million, up more than 200%, now representing 18% of total TCE


versus just 7% last year as former Maritrans fleet added 29 million to the current quarter TCE.


Switching to rates, rates in the second quarter were strong across all vessel segments. Average


spot TCE rates were stronger in the second quarter than the first quarter of 2000, except for


Aframax and for all vessel process, rates were higher year-over-year. Quickly, average spot TCE


rates for VLCCs were $53,000 a day versus $47,000 a day, up 15% year-over-year.


Average spot TCE rates for Aframax were up 21% to $32,000 a day versus just under $29,000 a


day last year. Average spot TCE rates for Panamaxes were up 27% to $34,000 a day versus


$27,000 a day in the same period a year ago.


And finally, average spot TCE rates for Handysize product carriers were up 32% to $35,000 a day


on $27,000 a day a year ago.


Please turn to Slide Four. Now there were both positive and negative factors influencing rates


during the second quarter. It is notable that second quarter rates were up year-over-year despite


OPEC Arab Gulf production being below second quarter 2006 levels, a negative you see in the


right box on the slide.


VLCC rates were bolstered by a number of factors. We saw a significant increase in seaborne


imports of crude oil into China, which increased by just -- by $400,000 per day, a trend now that’s


been continuing for several years, and reached $2.9 million barrels per day during the second


quarter of 2007.


Adding to the improved ton-mile picture, Venezuela and fuel oil movements to Asia continue to


increase.


A final factor that helps lift rates in the second quarter was 12 to 15 VLCCs in the U.S. Gulf being


used for storage.


Both in the second quarter and going forward, the increased output going to the BTC pipeline as


new fields coming on streaming in Angola, will benefit ton-mile growth. BTCs throughput increased


from 10,000 barrels per day with second quarter of 2006 to 500,000 barrels per day in 2007.


Liftings are expected to reach 1.2 million barrels a day by 2010.


In Angola, there was an increase in the first half from the Dalia fields and we expect another


250,000 barrels coming on when the Rosa Field comes on in Angola. The increased long haul


cargos coming out of BTC and in Angola will benefit the tanker market going forward.


Prior tanker rates were up significantly year-over-year due to increasing US demand combined with


the impact of planned and unplanned refinery down time in the USA. This resulted in increased
