MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Please standby. Good day everyone and welcome to the Southwestern Energy


Company Fourth Quarter 2004 and Year End Earnings Teleconference. This call is being


recorded.


And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the President, Chairman and Chief


Executive Officer, Mr. Harold Korell. Please go ahead sir.


Harold M. Korell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Richard Lane, our Executive Vice-


President of our Exploration & Production Company and Greg Kerley, our Chief Financial Officer. If


you have not received a copy of the press release, we announced yesterday, regarding our 2004


Financial results, you can call Annie at 281-618-4784 and she will fax a copy to you.


Also I would like to point out that many of the comments during this teleconference may be


regarded as forward-looking statements that involve risk factors and uncertainties that are detailed


in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We also would warn you that these forward-


looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.


Although, we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are


not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially.


Well, 2004 marked another record year for our Company as we set new highs in our financial


results and impressive marks in all the important operational statistics. We set new records, again,


for annual production volumes, reserve replacement and year end reserve levels, thanks to our


team of creative people and our discipline of adding value for each dollar that we invest.


Our financial results were outstanding as well as we delivered new records for earnings and cash


flow due to our increased production and higher commodity prices. Looking forward to 2005, we


plan to invest up to 339 million in our E&P [Exploration & Production] program, an increase of 20%


over our E&P capital in 2004. In East Texas, we plan to continue our high level of growing activity


at Overton by drilling 80 wells or so there. In our conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program, we


will increase the number of wells drilled to around 86, up from 70 wells drilled during 2004.


Specifically, we will be accelerating our activity at the Ranger Anticline, where we plan to double


the number of wells we drilled last year. In our Fayetteville Shale Play, we increased our leasehold


position to approximately 557,000 net acres in the undeveloped Play area by year end 2004. In


addition, we control approximately 125,000 net developed acres in the traditional Fairway area of


the Basin, that is held by conventional production.


As of February 28, we have drilled a total of 31 wells and participated in one outside operated well.


These were all vertical wells located in six separate pilot areas in Franklin, Conway, Van Buren and


Faulkner Counties in Arkansas. Of the 32 wells, 13 are on production, 7 are in the process of


completion or waiting on pipeline hook-up, 9 are scheduled to be completed and 3 were shut-in due


to marginal performance. Based on the average vertical well results to date and using current well


cost and our current forecast for the future performance of these wells, we believe that a vertical


well drilling program is economically feasible in the pilot areas drilled today.


While the results we are reporting are of the short-term nature and not based on extended


production histories, we continue to be excited about the potential of the Play. We are learning


more with each well we drill and have made improvements in lowering our drilling and completion


costs. Additionally, we are drilling our first horizontal well in the Play and we’ll be assessing its


potential to further improve the economic results. In 2005, we expect to allocate up to $100 million


of our E&P capital through our Fayetteville Shale Play. The Company's drilling program, with

respect to the Shale Play, is very flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors including: the


results of our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and economic


fracture stimulation and the gas commodity price environment. In summary, we are proud of our


results in 2004 and it looks like 2005 is shaping up to be another record year.


I will now turn the teleconference over to Richard Lane, who will tell you more about our E&P


results in 2004 and our plan for '05, then to Greg Kerley to discuss our financial results and then


answer your questions.


Richard F. Lane, Executive Vice President, Southwestern Energy Production Company &


SEECO, Inc.


Thank you and good morning. As Harold said, we set new records for our annual production,


reserve replacement and year end reserves in 2004.
 
Gas and oil production totaled 54.1 Bcfe


[billion cubic feet equivalent], up 31% from 41.2 Bcfe in 2003. The increase in 2004 production


resulted primarily from the continued development of our Overton Field in East Texas, our Ranger


Field in the Arkoma Basin and increased production from our River Ridge discovery in New Mexico.


Production for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 15.1 Bcfe, up 35% from the 11.2 Bcfe we produced in


the fourth quarter of '03. Of the 15.1 Bcfe of the fourth quarter production, 6.3 was from East


Texas, 5.4 from the Arkoma Basin, 2.2 from the Permian Basin and 1.2 from the Gulf Coast region.


The 15.1 Bcfe produced during the fourth quarter included the effects of curtailment of production at


our Overton Field in East Texas which were caused by the failure of a transmission line into which


we deliver a large portion of our gas production. The current lack of full sales capacity at Overton


Field, due to continued disruptions during the first quarter of 2005, will likely cause our production


be approximately 1 Bcfe less than our previously estimated first quarter production guidance of


14.5 to 15 Bcfe.


Current estimates for the first quarter of production are between 13.5 and 14.0 Bcfe while our


previously announced full year guidance of 61 to 63 Bcfe remains the same. We ended 2004 with


645.5 Bcfe of total proved oil and gas reserves which is up 28% from 503 Bcfe at year end 2003.


In 2004, we added 204.1 Bcfe from extensions and discoveries and 5.8 Bcfe from the acquisition of


additional interest in our Permian Basin River Ridge field. Total downward revisions for the


Company were 12.7 Bcfe. Of the 645.5 Bcfe of year end 2004 reserves, 299 Bcfe were in East


Texas, 239.5 Bcfe in the Arkoma Basin, 7.5 Bcfe in the Fayetteville Shale, 60.8 Bcfe in the Permian


Basin and 38.6 Bcfe in the Gulf Coast region. Including the effect of revisions, we replaced 365%


of our 2004 production at a finding development cost of $1.43 per Mcfe [million cubic feet


equivalent]. Proved developed reserves accounted for approximately 83% of our total and our


reserve life index was 11.9 years. In 2004, we invested $282 million in our Exploration &


Production program and participated in drilling 204 wells which compares to 139 wells in 2003. Of


the 2004 wells, 166 were successful, 14 were dry and 24 were still in progress at year end giving us


an overall success rate of 92%.


Approximately 81% of the $282 million invested in 2004 was in drilling. In 2004, we invested


approximately $28 million in our Fayetteville Shale Play, including a 11.6 million for drilling 21 wells,


bringing our total investment in the Play to $38.9 million. Total proved gas reserves booked in the


Play at year end 2004 were 7.5 Bcf from a total of 20 wells, 10 of which were classified as proved


undeveloped locations for an average gross estimate ultimate recovery per well of 430 million cubic


feet.


As Harold mentioned, as of the end of February, Southwestern had drilled a total of 31 wells and


participated in one outside operated well in the Fayetteville Shale Play. These vertical wells are in


six separate pilot areas located in Franklin, Conway, Van Buren and Faulkner Counties in


Arkansas. Of the 32 wells, 13 are on production, 9 are in the process of completion or waiting on
