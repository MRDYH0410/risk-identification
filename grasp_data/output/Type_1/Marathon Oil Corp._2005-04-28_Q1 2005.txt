MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your patience in holding and welcome to


this Marathon Oil Corporation First Quarter 2005 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being


recorded.


For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ken


Matheny. Please go ahead, sir.


Kenneth L. Matheny, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Affairs


Hey April, thank you very much. And, I also would like to welcome everybody to the First Quarter


2005 Earnings Teleconference for Marathon Oil Corporation.


With me on the call today from Marathon are Clarence Cazalot, President and CEO; Janet Clark,


Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hinchman, Senior Vice President of


Worldwide Production; Phil Behrman, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Exploration; and Steve


Lowden, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Integrated Gas. Also with me from


Marathon Ashland Petroleum are Gary Heminger, President; and Garry Peiffer, Senior Vice


President of Finance and Information Technology.


I will spend about 15 to 20 minutes reviewing the first quarter results and then Clarence Cazalot will


comment on our modified transaction to acquire Ashland’s 38% interest in MAP, which we


announced earlier today. We will then open the call to questions. Approximately two hours after


this call ends, these remarks will be placed on the Investor Relations portion of our website, they


will remain on the site for about, for one year.


My remarks today will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and


uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by


such statements. In accordance with the Safe Harbor provisions to the Private Securities Litigation


Reform Act of 1995 Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for


the year ended December 31st, 2004 and in subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language


identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to


differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.


A reconciliation of net income adjusted for special items to net income, including an explanation of


the reason for using this non-GAAP measure is included in our fourth quarter 2004 and first quarter


2005 earnings press releases. These press releases are posted on our website under the Press


Releases tab, which is located under the News Center tab. Unless otherwise indicated,


comparisons made in this conference call are to results from the fourth quarter 2005.


Net income for the first quarter was $324 million or 93 cents per share. Net income included an


after-tax special item of $33 million related to the mark-to-market loss on our two UK long-term gas


contracts.


Net income adjusted for special items was $357 million, or $1.02 per share and that was $58 million


lower than the fourth quarter of 2004 adjusted net income of $415 million, primarily because of


lower refining marketing transportation segment income, somewhat offset by higher upstream


segment income.


Looking at the upstream segment, total worldwide production available for sale for the quarter


averaged 347,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our guidance of 330,000 to 340,000

barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily due to the startup of Petronius and our acquisition of an


additional 16.7% interest in Troika.


Total sales volumes for the quarter were 334,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which differs


from production available for sale, as a result of the timing of liftings in the United Kingdom and


Gabon.


First quarter operating income of $555 million was $112 million higher than the fourth quarter of


2004, mainly the result of lower derivative losses, higher liquids and natural gas price realizations,


lower exploration expense and increased business interruption insurance recoveries related to


Petronius in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher DD&A.


Focusing on domestic upstream operations, first quarter operating income was $305 million, that’s


$67 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily a result of higher liquids volumes and


prices, lower derivative losses, lower exploration expense and as previously mentioned, business


interruption insurance related to Petronius. This was partially offset by lower gas volumes and


prices, and higher DD&A.


Our average domestic realized liquids price, excluding derivative activity, was $38.47 per barrel.


That was $3.63 more than the fourth quarter level, better than the increase in spot WTI of $1.76,


primarily because light-heavy differentials narrowed in the current quarter.


Our first quarter domestic gas price of $4.95 per MCF, excluding derivative activity, was down 14


cents from the fourth quarter, and our lower 48 gas sales, our realized price of $5.81, was 54 cents


below fourth quarter prices, as bid week prices, where we sell anywhere from 80 to 90% of our gas,


decreased 80 cents over the fourth quarter of 2004.


DD&A was $6.67 per barrel. That was $1.18 higher than the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of


the reserve adjustment made in the Powder River Basin last year. Domestic liquids sold in the first


quarter were 71.6 thousand barrels of liquids per day. That was up 6,200 barrels of liquids per day


from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the resumption of production at Petronius on March 11th,


and an additional 16.7% interest acquired at Troika in the Gulf of Mexico.


Domestic gas sales averaged 570 million cubic feet per day, down 15 million cubic feet per day


from the fourth quarter, because of lower volumes in Alaska and Camden Hills, which was shut in


for Hurricane Ivan repairs, partially offset by production from Petronius and Troika.


International upstream segment income for the first quarter was $250 million. That’s an increase of


$45 million over the fourth quarter, primarily attributable to higher gas prices and volumes,


decreased derivative related losses and lower exploration expense, partially offset by lower liquid


sales due to the timing of liftings.


Our foreign average liquids price of $39.10 per barrel was up 38 cents sequentially and that’s less


than the $3.77 increase in Dated Brent, primarily a result of the timing of liftings and domestic sales


of Russian production, which does not track Brent. Our average international gas price of $4.70


per MCF was up 38 cents on the strengthening of seasonal European gas prices. And DD&A of


$7.12 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter was essentially flat with the fourth quarter of last


year.


International liquids production available for sale in the first quarter were 104,000 barrels of liquids


a day, up 6,200 barrels of liquids a day from the previous quarter, primarily due to production


performance in Russia and EG Phase 2a startup. International sales in the first quarter were 91.5


thousand barrels of liquids per day, and that’s down 5.4 thousand barrels of liquids per day from the


fourth quarter, again as a result of timings of liftings in the UK and Gabon. Gas production of 455
