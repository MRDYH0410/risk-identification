MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Jessica, and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this


time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Home Capital Group Incorporated First Quarter 2011


Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.


After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]


Thank you.


Gerald Soloway, you may begin your conference.


Gerald M. Soloway, Chief Executive Officer and Director


Thank you, operator. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Home delivered a strong first quarter to


start 2011. The adjusted net income is up some 18.8%, our adjusted basic and diluted earnings is


$1.31 versus $1.11, $1.10 last year. Our net interest income is up 25.1% year-over-year. Our return


on equity was 26.7% and we at Home feel we made a very good start to the year 2011. Do you


know, the year 2011 with a return on equity of 26.7% if we continue will be the fourteenth


consecutive year with a return on equity over 20% and the ninth consecutive year with a return on


equity over 25%.


I know it’s only the first quarter, but the outlook is very good that we can continue that strong return


on equity and strong performance through the rest of the year. Now, over the last 14 years, we’ve


seen good times, we’ve seen a bad recession in the last few years, we’ve seen markets fluctuate


back and forth, and we are now seeing a slow-moving but steadily improving recovery from the


recession. And we see that trend continuing the rest of this year and into next.


In addition, this past quarter we have had the introduction of a new Canada-wide accounting


system, the IFRS, and a new regulatory system, Basel III, and a vigilant and enhanced regulatory


regime to help maintain Canada’s record of having a very safe and sound banking system. We are


in support of all of these initiatives, but it requires a great deal of effort to make all three changes


simultaneous and through it all Home has struck to its core strength, and continue to deliver very


good results for their shareholders.


We also have operated on a heightened and enhanced high capital ratios. At the end of the first


quarter, we had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 19; we had a total capital ratio of 20.3, and although the Tier


1 didn’t change, the total capital went up higher with the introduction of the new financing.


And after the quarter ended, Home raised $150 million in five-year debentures in the parent


company, Home Capital, and the parent passed $100 million down to Home Trust, which is the


regulated company, to meet future regulatory requirements and to support future growth. The $50


million that was left in the parent for the company’s general corporate purposes, when we put that


out in a press release, I got an email from a shareholder who wanted to know if I was going to use


the $50 million for a corporate jet. I want to give you clear guidance, the answer to the question is a


resounding no, not for a new plane now; not for any plane, not in the future, never on my watch as


CEO. So, I hope that puts an end to that rumor.


But, in conclusion, because I know people have a lot of questions, I want to just sort of sum up and


say, the business volume was good, the market is quite stable, the arrears are down year-over-year


from 0.47% last year to 0.29% this year. They’re up slightly from 2.4% at year-end and historically


they usually go up in the first quarter because of layoffs and unemployment over the winter, people


have trouble with heating bills, and usually there’s a bit of a hangover from Christmas spending.


So, we are not concerned that we’re up slightly over the fourth quarter, but we’re very pleased with


how we are on a year-over-year basis. And the outlook for arrears, it looks pretty steady at the

present levels for the rest of the year. We look back to 2005-2006, before the recession, and the


nonperforming is in line with what we had experienced in a more stable housing market at that time


before the recession.


So we think that the housing market has pretty much returned to its pre-recession level, and


performance is very good. [audio gap] (6:10) We see a further growth and that will be growth within


our risk appetite, it’ll be in all areas of the company and we see ourselves having a very good year


in 2011, a continuation of the first quarter, as steady as you go, and with good returns throughout.


Anyways, those are my prepared remarks and I’m sure there’s lots of questions. So I’ll throw it


open to questions at this time.
