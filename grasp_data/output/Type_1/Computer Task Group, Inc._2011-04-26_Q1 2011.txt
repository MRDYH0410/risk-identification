first quarter of 2011 we exceeded the upper end of our guidance for revenue and were at the high


end of our guidance for earnings per share. For the full year we’re now projecting at the midpoint of


our revised guidance a revenue increase over 2010 of 18% and an increase in our earnings per


share of 35%. Our revenue and earnings continue to grow as the demand for our services expands


both as a result of the continued need in the United States for staffing services and as the


healthcare industry invests in electronic medical records.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the 2011 second quarter and the full


year, but first I’m going to ask Brendan to start us off with the review of our financial results.


Brendan?


Brendan M. Harrington, CFO, SVP & Head-Investor Relations


Thanks, Jim. Good morning. For the first quarter of 2011 CTG’s revenue was $95.9 million, an


increase of $17.4 million or 22% compared with the first quarter of 2010. On a sequential basis


compared with the trailing fourth quarter of 2010 revenue increased 10% and was 5% higher per


billing day.


Solutions revenue in the first quarter 2011 was $33.7 million, an increase of $8.6 million or 34%


compared to last year’s first quarter. As a percentage of total revenue, solutions revenue was 35%


compared with 32% a year ago, driven mainly by an increase in revenue from a higher level of


EMR work. Continued strong demand in the quarter increased staffing revenue by $8.8 million or


16.5% to $62.2 million.


First quarter revenue from IBM, our largest customer, was $28.7 million compared with $22.6


million in the same period last year. As a percent of total revenue IBM increased to 29.9% in the


first quarter 2011 compared with 28.8% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was $17.1 million, up 3.1% increase from the $16.6 million


recorded in last year’s first quarter. The recovery in Europe continues to lag that of the U.S. as


indicated by the lower growth rate of our European business. The effect of the foreign currency


fluctuations during the first quarter of 2011 had only limited impact on our overall revenue and was


equal to approximately $170,000 or 0.2% as compared with the first quarter of 2010.


Direct costs as a percentage of revenue were 79.4% in the first quarter compared with 78.3% in the


first quarter of 2010 and 78.1% in the trailing fourth quarter of 2010. SG&A expenses as a percent


of revenue decreased to 15.8% from 17.7% in the first quarter of 2010 and 17.1% in the trailing


fourth quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects the operating leverage from higher revenue and


continued discipline in controlling costs.


First quarter operating income expanded at a greater rate than revenue and was $4.6 million, up


$1.5 million or 49% year-over-year. Compared with the trailing fourth quarter of 2010, first quarter


operating income increased $364,000 or 8.6%. Operating margin in the first quarter increased to


4.8% of revenue, a 90 basis point improvement from last year’s 3.9%. Our operating margin


benefited from an increase in the profitability of solutions projects due to the higher proportion of


EMR work, cost controls and the additional operating leverage.


Net income was $2.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 58% from $1.8 million in the first quarter


of 2010 and a 6.6% increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 net income. On a per diluted share


basis, net income was $0.17 for the quarter, a 55% increase from first quarter 2010, and a 6%


increase from the 2010 fourth quarter. Both the 2011 and 2010 first quarter’s results, include equity


compensation expense of approximately $0.01 per diluted share net of tax.
