MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Welcome to Vector Group’s Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Before the


call begins, I would like to read the safe harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing.


Now, I would turn the conference over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s third quarter 2010 earnings


conference call. With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and Chief Executive Officer of


Liggett Vector Brands and Liggett, and Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call, I will provide an update on our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the third quarter and nine months ending September 30, 2010.


Ron will then discuss the performance of Liggett for the period and provide his views on the


industry developments, and the competitive environment. After that, we will take your questions.


Let me begin by saying that we remain very pleased with our company’s performance and volume


growth trends through the third quarter of 2009.


As we have noted, we made the decision to strategically invest in the growth of our tobacco


business in advance of the April 2009 legislation that increased the federal excise tax on cigarettes


by $6.17 per carton and legislation that ultimately granted the Food and Drug Administration


regulatory authority of the tobacco products. The success of this strategy that we put into place is


reflected in Liggett Vector Brands’ third quarter 2010 wholesale shipment growth in excess of 25%,


compared to the year-ago quarter.


And year-to-date, we have achieved wholesale shipment growth of almost 28%. Looking beyond


the short-term, we are committed to a program of sustainable growth in our tobacco business and


Ron will provide more detail on that in a moment.


With respect to real estate, we continue to see positive signs in a challenging market environment.


We are very pleased with Douglas Elliman’s reported net income of 34.1 million for the nine-month


period ended September 30th, 2010, which is the highest in its history for the first nine months of


the year.


We still believe that there are good investment opportunities in this market and we are pursuing


appropriate opportunities that meet our criteria.


At this point, I want to briefly address the tobacco litigation environment and specifically


developments with respect to the Engle Cases. As previously noted, the primary focus of our


current litigation activity is be the Engle progeny cases in Florida. There are approximately 7,000


cases pending with more than half of them in federal court, and the balance in Florida State court.


We, along with the other industry defendants continue to believe that the Engle process is


materially flawed and unconstitutional. While we believe, we have very strong arguments and that

recently received a potentially significant favorable ruling in federal court that we referenced on the


last quarter’s call, there is still considerable risk and we remain subject to the ongoing process and


periodic negative judgments.


As previously reported, in June 2010, we paid 14.4 million to resolve the judgment in the Lukacs


case, which was the first Engle progeny case tried. Although the verdict was rendered years in


advance of the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling on the Engle case, which overturned certain findings


that the jury in Lukacs relied upon in assessing liability the Appellate Court chose not to review this


case. This is the largest judgment against Liggett to-date, and it was the result of what we believe


to be unique circumstances.


The Federal Court ruling from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, impacts approximately 3900 Engle


progeny cases pending federal court. We believe the court’s rulings will likely result in significant


restrictions on the ability of plaintiffs in federal court to use phase one findings determined by the


prior Engle jury to meet their burden of proof at trial.


We agree with the industry leader that this ruling should also provide persuasive authority for


Florida state courts that have been allowing plaintiffs to rely on the Engle findings, without satisfying


the requirements of Florida law, or due process. We are encouraged by this development and


believe it could have a positive impact on the future direction of the Engle cases.


In addition, while the industry has had adverse jury verdicts in 19 Engle cases, the industry has


prevailed, even through mistrial or defense verdict in 11 cases, including defense verdicts in the 5


most recent cases that have gone to trial. The adverse verdicts are all expected to be appealed.


Before discussing the financial results, I’m also pleased to remind you that in April 2010, we


enhanced our strong financial position by completing a private placement of an additional 75 million


of our 11% senior secured notes, due 2015.


Our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of approximately 258.6 million as of


September 30th, 2010. Additionally, as of September 30th, 2010, we held investment securities and


partnership interest with a fair market value of approximately 151.6 million.


Now, let’s turn to the key financials for the three months and nine months ended September 30th


2010 for Vector Group. For the third quarter-ended September 30th, 2010, Vector Group revenues


were 295.1 million, compared to 236.7 million in the 2009 third quarter. The increase in revenues in


2010 was primarily due to increased cigarette unit volumes. The company recorded operating


income of 29.9 million in the 2010 third quarter, compared to operating income of 37 million in the


2009 third quarter.


Third quarter 2010 net income was 10.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to 16.2


million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the corresponding 2009 period. Excluding a 3 million pre-tax


non-recurring settlement charge, and 1.7 million of pre-tax gains from changes in fair value of


derivatives embedded within our convertible debt, third quarter 2010 net income was 11.7 million,


or $0.15 per diluted share.


Excluding 6.1 million of pre-tax charges from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within


our convertible debt and a recognition of a one-time income tax benefit of 6.2 million, third quarter


2010 net income was 13.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share.


For the nine months ended September 30th, 2010, Vector Group revenues were 785.7 million,


compared to 564.7 million in the first nine months of 2009. The increase in revenues in 2010 was


primarily due to increased volumes and higher prices related to the federal excise tax increase,


which became effective on April 1st, 2009. The company recorded operating income of 82 million
