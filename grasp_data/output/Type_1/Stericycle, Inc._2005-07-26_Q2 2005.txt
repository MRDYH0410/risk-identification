MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good days ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Stericycle Second Quarter


Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for


today's conference, Ms. Liz Brandel, Vice President of Finance. Ms. Brandel, you may begin.


Elizabeth Brandel, Vice President of Finance


Thank you. I will be reading the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this


conference call which are not historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve


known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the Company's


Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as in other filings with the SEC could affect the Company's actual results


and could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from expected results.


The Company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or


any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.


During the conference call, we may refer to our total debt to capitalization percentage. This is


calculated by using the total debt as numerator and the total debt plus shareholder equity in the


denominator. We consider this ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance


sheet. It is not a measure in accordance with GAAP accounting principles and is not a measure of


net income, cash flow or liquidity. And with that, I'd like to pass the call to Mark Miller.


Mark C. Miller, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director


Thank you, Liz. Well, good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me


today are Frank ten Brink, our Chief Financial Officer; Rich Kogler, our Chief Operating Officer; and


Liz Brandel, Vice President of Finance. Once again, we are pleased with the results achieved by


our team in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $23 million and earnings


per share was 51 cents. For 36 consecutive quarters since our IPO in 1996, we've either met or


exceeded expectations for our Company's performance. With that brief overview, I'll turn the call


over to Frank.


Frank J.M. ten Brink, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer


Thanks, Mark. Revenues grew 25.4 million in the quarter, to 149.1 million, up 20.5% from 123.8


million in the second quarter of '04, up 25.4 million of growth. Small quantity, our most profitable


sector was up approximately 6.3 million or over 9%. Large quantity revenues were up


approximately 2.5 million or 6%. International equipment sales were down by approximately 2.9


million in the quarter versus the prior year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed


approximately 17.2 million to the growth in the quarter. Excluding international equipment sales


and acquisitions, the internal growth was over 8%.


Customer revenue mix was approximately 63% in small and 37% in large customers. As in the


past, this mix is calculated excluding international operations, 3CI and acquisitions. Year-over-year


gross profit as a percent of revenue was 43.8% in the quarter, versus 44.7% last year due to mix


effect of White Rose acquisition in June of '04 and lower equipment sales.


Gross margins were sequentially up by 42 basis points as the result of continued improvement in


our base business, both domestically and internationally, partially offset by lower margins on the


new acquisitions and continued operating cost headwinds.

SG&A excluding amortization was 15.2% of revenues or 22.7 million in the quarter. Income from


operations in the quarter was 42 million or 28.1% of revenues.


Net interest expense in the second quarter was 3.1 million versus 2.5 million in 2004 due to higher


borrowings. As previously reported on July 5th, during the second quarter, we obtained a new 400


million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As a result of the new credit facility, we had a one-


time charge in the second quarter of 0.2 million from unamortized finance fees related to our prior


credit agreements.


Other expense in the quarter was 0.9 million versus 0.5 million in the prior year due to the non-cash


mark-to-market on the intercompany loan with our U.K. subsidiary. Net income for the second


quarter was 23 million, and EPS was 51 cents for the quarter versus 41 cents last year.


Now the balance sheet. Our debt-to-book capitalization at the end of the quarter was 33.3%. At


the end of the second quarter, the revolver was 199 million. As a result of our new credit line we no


longer have a Term A loan. The unused portion of our new line is approximately 158 million.


During the quarter we repurchased 117,600 shares of common stock on the open market in an


amount of approximately 5.2 million. This differs from the cash flow due to funds going out in early


April for the end of March repurchases. Cumulative, we have now bought back 1,997,630 shares.


In the quarter, our CapEx was 7.4 million. The DSO in the quarter was 51 days versus 47 days a


year ago due to some of the new acquisitions which did not include working capital and invoice


timing.


Now, some balance sheet numbers. Cash and equivalents, 11.2 million; accounts receivable, 86.2


million; current assets, 139 million; total assets, 910.5 million; short-term debt, 8.3 million; long-term


debt, 245.8 million with a total debt of 254.1 million; net worth, 508.7 million. Depreciation in the


quarter was 4.8 million with amortization of 0.4 million and, as mentioned, total debt to cap was


33.3%.


Now a brief recap of the 6 months numbers. For the 6 months ended June 30th, revenues


increased to 289.7 million, an increase of 20% from the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a


percent of revenue was 43.6% for the 6 months ended June 30th, '05, versus 45% for the 6 months


ended June 30th, '04.


Earnings per share increased 20.7% to 99 cents per share from 82 cents per diluted share in the


same period a year ago. Cash provided from operations for the 6 months was 57.1 million in '05.


This concludes the financial picture. I will now turn over it to Rich Kogler.


Richard T. Kogler, EVP and Chief Operating Officer


Thanks, Frank. We want to begin by recognizing the operating team for their strong performance


this quarter. In spite of continued operating cost headwinds they once again delivered solid gross


margins. During the quarter, all of our operating locations stayed focused on their individual


productivity and cost containment strategies.


We're particularly pleased that we have nearly completed the internalization of our volume into the


new Baltimore plant. This will eliminate long haul transportation and third party treatment costs in


that district. A special thanks to the Baltimore operating team who worked continuously throughout


the quarter to ramp up the new plant. We also thank the sales team for their performance in the


quarter. Because of their hard work, we saw growth in all areas with increased SteriSafe and LQG


revenues.
