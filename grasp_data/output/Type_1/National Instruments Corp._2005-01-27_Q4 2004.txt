MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the National Instruments Corporation's Fourth


Quarter 2004 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. You may refer to


your press packet for the replay dial-in number and passcode. The replay will be available from 7


PM Central Time today and will end at midnight Central Time on February 2, 2005. With us today


are Dr. James Truchard, President and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Davern, Chief Financial


Officer, and John Graff, Vice President of Marketing. For opening remarks, I would now like to turn


the conference over to Mr. David Hugley, Corporate Counsel. Mr. Hugley, please go ahead, Sir.


David Hugley, Corporate Counsel


Good afternoon. During the course of this conference call, we shall make forward-looking


statements regarding the future financial performance of the Company, including statements


regarding our expected revenue and earnings per share, strong new product output in 2005, and


expanding market opportunities. We wish to caution you that such statements are just predictions,


and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the


Company files regularly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's


annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and our Form 10-Q for the


quarter ended September 30, 2004. These documents contain and identify important factors that


could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking


statements. With that, I will now turn it over to the President and CEO of National Instruments


Corporation, Dr. James Truchard.


James Truchard, President & Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, David. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our key points today are record


quarterly revenue, up 9% sequentially, record sales of LabVIEW, PXI, Data Acquisition and Module


Instruments in Q4; and record annual revenue up 21% year-over-year with net income of 46%. We


are pleased with the strong sales of our virtual instrumentation platform in Q4. Our strong


investments in R&D, coupled with excellent sales and marketing execution, resulted in record


revenue for the quarter and for the year.


In our call today, Alex Davern, our CFO, will review our financials, John Graff, our Vice President of


Marketing will discuss our business; and I will close with a few comments before we open up for


your questions. Alex.


Alexander Davern, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you for joining us today. We had a strong Q4 with revenue of $137 million, up 12% from Q4


2003 and up 9% sequentially. This represents the highest quarterly revenue in NI's history. The


sequential growth in Q4 is in line with the average Q4 sequential increase we typically see. Our


growth rate in Q4 is significant when compared to the unusually high 16% sequential revenue


growth we saw in Q4 of 2003.


Revenue for the full year was $514 million, up 21% from 2003. This represents the highest annual


revenue in NI's history. We are pleased to pass the milestone of $0.5 billion in revenue. I feel that


in 2004 we made good progress towards our goal of reaching $1 billion in revenue in 2008.

Fully diluted earnings per share for Q4 was 20 cents with net income of $16.5 million, up 47% from


Q4 2003. This represents the highest quarterly net income in NI's history. Net income for the full


year was $49 million, a 46% increase over 2003. Fully diluted earnings per share was 59 cents per


share. With a 21% increase in revenue and a 46% increase in net income, we are pleased to have


delivered on our goal of driving operating leverage in 2004.


Now looking at Q4 revenue in more detail. Sales of our Instrument Control products were down 3%


sequentially, and down 4% year-over-year. And we’re impacted by weak sales in Test &


Measurement and semiconductor capital equipment companies and by a decline in the Global PMI


during Q4. Sales of rest of our product portfolio, i.e., our virtual instrumentation platforms were up


16% year-over-year compared to a very strong Q4 last year.


During Q4 we saw growth in all regions. Revenue was up 11% in Europe and Asia and was up


15% in the Americas, giving overall growth of 12%. We believe that the slowdown in year-over-


year growth in Europe is due to the weakening of the industrial economies in Europe during Q4. In


Asia, our growth rate was pulled down by a 16% decline in sales of our Instrument Control


products, which make up a larger percentage of our Asian revenues. However, we continue to see


good growth in our virtual instrumentation products in Asia, which had growth of over 20%.


Now we’ll look in more detail at the income statement for the quarter. Gross margins in Q4 were


73.5%, up from 72.7% in Q3 on a 9% sequential increase in revenue. Total operating expenses


were $79.3 million up 3% over Q4 2003. Total expenses included a $2.1 million net credit for


patent litigation and an expense of approximately $2 million for educational donations. Our R&D


expenses were flat sequentially and were up 6% year-over-year. Software development expenses


capitalized in the quarter amounted to $860,000. Also during the quarter, $1.9 million in previously


capitalized software development costs were amortized to cost of goods sold.


Sales of marketing expenses were up by $2.2 million sequentially, and by 12% year-over-year.


This included approximately $2 million in donations, which we made to 150 educational institutions


worldwide in Q4. Consistent with what we said in our October earnings call, we used $2 million of


the award we received from The MathWorks case in Q4 to further engineering education, and to


extend the adoption of LabVIEW and our virtual instrumentation platforms in universities worldwide.


The net patent litigation credit of $2.1 million is made up of two elements. The first represents a net


gain of approximately $6 million from damages related to the Court of Appeals affirmation of our


victory against The MathWorks in our 2003 jury trial. This gain is offset by a $4 million charge we


have taken in Q4 related to a new patent case concerning The MathWorks newly released version


of Simulink. This new version of SimuLink – service pack 1 for release 14 – was released by The


MathWorks in an effort to avoid the court's infringement injunction. While this release did remove


some functionality from Simulink, we believe that this new version continues to infringe NI's


LabVIEW patents. The Federal court for the Eastern district of Texas has ruled that a new trial is


needed to decide the infringement issues presented by the newly released version of SimuLink.


This charge of $4 million represents the accrual for estimated legal costs to take this case through


trial.


G&A expenses in Q4 were up 20% year-over-year and included approximately $1.4 million related


to our efforts to comply with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. For 2004, we estimate this cost at


approximately $2.5 million.


Now looking below the operating income line, other operating expenses included a net charge of


$2.3 million, related to a $2.5 million write-off of an investment, offset by a $242,000 gain on the


sale of a subsidiary. The $2.5 million write-off related to a 10% minority position NI owns in a small


start up. This investment was made in 2001 and represents the only minority investment that NI


has. As a result of a deterioration in the performance of this Company and weakened prospects for


future profitability, we took this charge in Q4.
