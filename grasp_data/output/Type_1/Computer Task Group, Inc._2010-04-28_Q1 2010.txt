MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the


CTG First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.


Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.


[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.


I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, IR for CTG, Mr. Jim Culligan. Please go


ahead.


James M. Culligan, Vice President, Kei Advisors LLC


Thank you, Dimetria and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and your


interest in CTG. On the call today, we have CTG’s CEO, Jim Boldt; and Brendan Harrington,


Senior Vice President and CFO. Jim and Brendan are going to review the results for the first


quarter of 2010 and update you on the company’s strategy and outlook. We’ll follow with an


opportunity for Q&A. If you don’t have the news release discussing our financial results, you can


access it at the company’s website, ctg.com.


Before we begin, I want to mention that statements in the course of this conference call that state


the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectation, and predictions for the


future, are forward-looking statements. It’s important to note that the company’s actual results


could differ materially from those projected.


Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the


forward-looking statement is contained in our earnings release as well as in the company’s SEC


filings. You can find these on our website or at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. So please


review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.


With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jim to begin the discussion.


James R. Boldt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this


morning for our first quarter earnings conference call. You saw in our earnings release, in the first


quarter 2010 we exceeded our guidance for revenue and we’re at the midpoint of our guidance for


earnings per share. In the first quarter, we added 200 or 7% to our staff, bringing our total head


count to 3,100.


We continue to see strong demand for our services in the second quarter 2010. The majority of


that demand is coming from electronic medical record projects and our U.S. staffing business. As


we said before, all indications are that CTG is going to have a good year this year.


I’m going to talk more about our results and what we see for the second quarter in the year. But


first, I’m going to ask Brendan to start us off with a review of our financial results. Brendan?


Brendan Harrington, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2010, CTG’s revenue was 78.5


million, an increase of 3.9 million or 5% compared with the first quarter of 2009. On a sequential

basis, compared with the trailing fourth quarter of 2009, revenue increased 16% and was 11%


higher per billing day.


First quarter operating income expanded at a greater rate than revenue and was 3.1 million, up


682,000 or 28% year-over-year. Compared with the trailing fourth quarter of 2009, first quarter


operating income increased 519,000 or 20.1%. Operating margin in the first quarter increased to


3.9% of revenue, a 70 basis point improvement from last year’s 3.2%. Our operating margin


benefited from an increase in the profitability of solutions projects and the additional operating


leverage.


Net income was 1.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 37% from 1.3 million in the first quarter of


2009 and a 9.6% increase from fourth quarter of 2009 net income. On a per diluted share basis,


net income was $0.11 for the quarter, a 22% increase from first quarter of 2009 and 10% increase


from the 2009 fourth quarter.


Solutions revenue in the first quarter 2010 was 25.1 million, approximately equal to last year’s first


quarter. As a percentage of total revenue, solutions revenue was 32% compared with 34% a year


ago. Driven by strong demand in the quarter, staffing revenue increased 3.9 million or 8% to 53.4


million.


First quarter revenue from IBM, our largest customer, was 22.6 million, compared with 19.1 million


in the same period last year. As a percent of total revenue, IBM increased to 28.8% in the 2010


first quarter, compared with 25.6% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year.


Revenue from our European operations was 16.6 million, a 6.4% decrease from the 17.7 million


recorded in last year’s first quarter, as recovery in Europe continues to lag that of the U.S.


Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, European revenue in the quarter would have decreased


12% from last year. The effect of the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar during the first quarter of 2010


increased our revenue by approximately 900,000 or 1.2% as compared with the first quarter of


2009.


SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 17.7% from 19.2% in the first quarter of


2009 and from 18.4% in the trailing fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement reflects the operating


leverage from higher revenue and continued discipline in controlling our costs. Direct costs as a


percentage of revenue were 78.3% in the first quarter, compared with 77.6% in the first quarter of


2009 and 77.8% in the trailing fourth quarter of 2009.


Both the 2010 and 2009 first quarter’s results include equity compensation expense of


approximately $0.01 per diluted share net of tax. The tax rate for the 2010 first quarter was 41.3%


compared with 42.3% in the 2009 first quarter. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2010 to be


between 40 and 42%.


As Jim noted, our head count has been increasing. We had approximately 3,100 employees at the


end of Q1 2010, of which 89% were billable resources. On the balance sheet, our days sales


outstanding was 61 days at the end of the first quarter 2010, an increase of 3 days compared with


the end of the first quarter of 2009 and slightly above the 60 days at the end of 2009.


Our cash used in operations in the first quarter of 2010 was approximately 5 million as compared


with cash used in operations of approximately 400,000 in the first quarter of 2009. The increase of


cash used in the comparative quarters was primarily attributed to fluctuations in the accounts


receivable balances at the end of the comparative period. We had 572,000 in capital expenditures


focused mostly on solutions development and we recorded depreciation expense of 392,000 in the


quarter.
