MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Welcome to Encore Wire Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all


lines will be on listen-only mode. There will be time for question-and-answer, at the end of the call.


[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Daniel Jones, President and CEO of Encore


Wire. Go ahead please.


Daniel L. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer


Well thank you Steven. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Encore Wire


Corporation, quarterly conference call. I’m Daniel Jones, the President and Chief Executive Officer


of Encore Wire. With me this morning is Frank Bilban, our Chief Financial Officer.


We’re pleased to be able to announce strong quarterly earnings in the midst of the severe


recession, currently taking place in the construction industry. As we repeatedly noted the key metric


to earnings is the spread between the price of wire sold and the cost of raw copper.


The spread increased 35.7% in the second quarter of 2010, versus the second quarter of 2009.


While our unit volume shipped in the second quarter of 2010 increased 2.3%, versus second


quarter of 2009. The spread increased 14.7% on a sequential quarter basis, while unit volume


increased 34.1%.


The sequential quarterly comparisons are particularly encouraging. We believe the sequential


trends are due to several factors. In the first quarter of 2010, we posted our lowest unit sales in


over a decade. We believe this was due not only to the construction and building wire recession in


the United States, but also due to the fact that a former competitor was purchased and liquidated


their remaining wire inventory during the first quarter at extremely low prices.


We elected not to match these price levels, negatively impacting our unit volume in the first quarter.


In the second quarter, the building wire industry exhibited improved pricing discipline, favorably


impacting our spreads and allowed our unit volume to return to what we believe may be more


normal levels.


We continue to strive to support industry price increases to maintain the momentum started during


the past quarter. We believe our superior order fill rates continued to enhance our competitive


position as our electrical distributor customers are holding very lean inventories in the field. As


orders come in from the electrical contractors, the distributors can count on our order fill rates to


ensure quick deliveries from coast-to-coast.


We’ve been able to accomplish this, despite holding, what are historically lean inventories for us.


We believe our performance is impressive in this economy. We thank our employees and


associates for tremendous efforts. We also thank our shareholders for their continued support.


Frank Bilban our Chief Financial Officer will now discuss our financial results. Frank.


Frank J. Bilban, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Daniel. In a minute we will review Encore’s financial results for the quarter.


After the financial review, we will take any questions you may have. Each of you should have


received a copy of Encore’s press release covering our financial results. This release is available


on the Internet or you can call Denise List at 800-962-9473 and we will get you a copy.

Before we review the financials, let me indicate that in these initial comments and in the question-


and-answer period that follows, we may make certain statements that might be considered to be


forward-looking.


In order to comply with certain securities legislation and instead of attempting to identify each


particular statement as forward-looking, we advise you that all such statement involves certain risks


and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here


today. I refer each of you to the company’s SEC reports and news releases, for a more detailed


discussion of these risks and uncertainties.


Also reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call to the most directly


comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including EBITDA, which we


believe to be useful supplemental information for investors, are posted on www.encorewire.com.


Now for the financial results; net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, were $236.1


million compared to $159.4 million during the second quarter of 2009. Higher prices for building


wires sold in the quarter ended June 30, 2010 accounted for most of the increase in net sales


dollars, increasing 44.9% per copper pound sold versus the same period in 2009. Sales prices rose


primarily due to higher copper prices. Unit volume in the second quarter of 2010 increased 2.3%


versus the second quarter of 2009. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 increased 1,256.5%


to $8.1 million versus $600,000 in the second quarter of 2009. Fully diluted net earnings per


common share were $0.35 in the second quarter of 2010 versus $0.03 in the second quarter of


2009.


Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $411.3 million compared to $303.8 million


during the same period in 2009. Higher prices for building wire sold in the six months ended June


30, accounted for the increase in net sales dollars, increasing 59.2% per copper pound versus the


same period in 2009. Unit volume in the six months ended June 30, decreased 14.9% versus the


same period in 2009. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $5.7 million versus


$5.2 million in the same period in 2009. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $0.24


for the six months ended June 30, 2010 versus $0.22 in the same period in 2009.


On a sequential quarter comparison, net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $236.1 million


versus $175.2 million during the first quarter of 2010. Unit volume increased 34.1% on a sequential


quarter comparison. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $8.1 million versus a loss of


2.5 million in the first quarter of 2010. Fully diluted net income per common share was $0.35 in the


second quarter of 2010 versus a loss of $0.11 in the first quarter of 2010.


Our balance sheet remains strong. We have no long-term debt, and our revolving line of credit is


paid down to zero. In addition, we have $90.5 million in cash as of June 30, 2010. We also declared


another quarterly cash dividend during the second quarter of 2010.


We want everyone to know that this conference call will be available for replay after the conclusion


of this session. If you wish to hear the taped replay, please call 866-551-4520 and enter the
