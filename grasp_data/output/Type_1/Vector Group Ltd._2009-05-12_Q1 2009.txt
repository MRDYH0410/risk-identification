MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Hello, and welcome to Vector Group’s First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call.


Before the call begins, I’d like to read a Safe Harbor statement.


The statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking


statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks are


described in more detail in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.


I’d now like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group,


Howard Lorber.


Howard M. Lorber, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Vector Group’s first quarter 2009 earnings


conference call. With me today is Ron Bernstein, the President and CEO of Liggett Vector Brands


and Liggett, and Bryant Kirkland, Vector’s Chief Financial Officer.


On today’s call I will provide an overview of our business and review Vector Group’s financials for


the first quarter of 2009. Ron will then discuss the performance of Liggett Group and Vector


Tobacco for the period and provide an update on industry developments and the competitive


environment. After that, we will take your questions.


Let me begin by noting that, as expected, the federal excise tax increase of $6.17 per carton to


fund the State Children’s Health Insurance, or SCHIP legislation, as it is known, became effective


on April 1, 2009. As anticipated, this extraordinary tax increase had an impact on our first quarter


performance, as it did on all other industry participants, and will likely impact our conventional


tobacco business performance throughout the balance of the year and beyond.


Importantly, we believe that this changing landscape presents some interesting opportunities for us,


which Ron will cover in more detail following my review of Vector Group’s financial results.


Before discussing the financial results for the quarter, I’m very pleased with yesterday’s announced


completion of a $50 million private placement of our convertible notes due November 2014. The


purchaser is an affiliate of Dr. Phillip Frost, one of our country’s most successful entrepreneurs. The


proceeds of the offering will further add to our strong liquidity position and will be available for


general corporate purposes.


Our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $202.3 million as of


March 31, 2009. In addition, as of March 31, 2009, we held investment securities and partnership


interests with a fair market value of approximately 79.2 million.


Now, let’s turn to the key financials for the three months ended March 31, 2009, for Vector Group.


Our financial results for the 2009 period included a pre-tax gain of $5 million related to the 1999


Trademark transaction with Philip Morris, which was offset by a pre-tax impairment charge of 8.5


million on real estate and pre-tax restructuring charges of $1 million.


Our financial results from the 2008 period include 12 million of pre-tax income from the St. Regis


Hotel sale. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, Vector Group revenues were 121.2 million


compared to 132.2 million in the 2008 first quarter. The company recorded operating income of


31.2 million in the 2009 first quarter compared to operating income of 28 million in the 2008 first


quarter. First quarter 2009 net income was 3.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to net


income of 14.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the 2008 period.

Excluding the gain on the Trademark transaction and the impairment losses and restructuring


charges in the 2009 period, the company’s net income for the 2009 first quarter was 5.7 million or


$0.08 per diluted share. Excluding the 12 million income from the St. Regis Hotel sale, the


company’s net income for the 2008 first quarter was 7.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share.


Now I will turn the call over to Ron Bernstein for a review of our Tobacco subsidiaries. Liggett’s


numbers reflect sales for both Liggett Group’s cigarettes and conventional cigarette products from


Vector Tobacco.


Ron?


Ronald J. Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Liggett Group Inc. and Liggett


Vector Brands Inc


Thanks, Howard, and good morning everyone. As Howard noted, on April 1, 2009, a $6.17 per


carton federal excise tax increase on cigarettes became effective. As it is the largest federal tax or


fee increase on tobacco in history, it significantly impacted Liggett and the industry during the


quarter and will continue to do so going forward.


On February 9, the industry leader announced a price increase of $0.90 per carton on its major


brands. This was then followed with a $7.10 per carton increase on March 9. The remainder of the


big-three followed suit shortly thereafter, and by March 31, the rest of the industry had all increased


prices by at least $6.17 per carton. Initially, because of the early March timing of FET-related price


increases by the large manufacturers, there was a great deal of confusion among trade wholesalers


and retailers, with many believing that another large price increase would occur on April 1, the


effective date of the tax increase.


This resulted in significant trade loading both before and after the big-three announcements. As it


became clear to the trade that another increase was unlikely, it also became clear to wholesalers


and retailers that they would be responsible for paying a $6.17 per carton floor tax to the federal


government on all their inventories as of March 31. Since prices had already been increased by the


manufacturers to recover the additional tax expense, wholesalers and retailers would be forced to


pay out of their own pockets the additional $6.17 per carton for any inventory they held as of March


31. This led to an unprecedented de-load of trade inventory at the end of the first quarter.


As a result, and in order to comply with the trade programs of the big-three -- programs that we


have long believed to be anticompetitive -- as the industry de-load took place, wholesalers and


retailers first attempted to assure that they had sufficient inventory to meet their big-three program


requirements and aggressively reduced all other inventory. No one was spared from this de-load


activity including the big-three, but we believe that we and other smaller manufacturers were


disproportionately impacted. With that in mind, let me now review the numbers.


For the three months ended March 31, 2009, our conventional cigarettes generated revenues of


120.9 million compared to 131.6 million for the corresponding period in 2008. Operating income for


the three months ended March 31, 2009, was 38.4 million compared to 37.3 million for the


corresponding 2008 period. Included in the March 31, ‘09 operating income is the one-time gain of


5 million related to the 1999 Trademark transaction with Philip Morris.


Additionally, Liggett’s first quarter earnings were negatively impacted by 1.6 million compared to the


prior-year period due to 2008 investment losses in the Liggett pension plan. For the three months


ended March 31, 2009, Vector Tobacco’s operating losses were 2.8 million compared to operating


losses of 2.4 million for the prior-year period.
