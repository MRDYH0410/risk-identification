MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the CTG fourth quarter


2006 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will


conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given that time. If you should require


assistance during this call, please press star then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being


recorded.


I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. James Boldt. Please go ahead sir.


James Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman


Good morning everyone. This is Jim Boldt. I want to thank you for joining us this morning for the


fourth quarter 2006 earnings conference call. Joining me is our CFO, Brendan Harrington. As for


the format of the call this morning, Brendan is going to begin with a review of our financial results


and then I will talk about the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter as well as what we anticipate


for 2007 and then we will open the call for questions.


Brendan would you start us off please?


Brendan Harrington, Chief Financial Officer


Sure. Thanks Jim. Good morning. Before I begin I want to mention that statements made in the


course of this conference call, should state that the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes,


beliefs, expectations, and predictions on the future are forward-looking statements. It is important to


not that the company’s actual results could differ materially from those projected. Additional


information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-


looking statements is contained in our news releases and from time to time in the company’s SEC


filings.


For the fourth quarter of 2006, CTG’s revenues were 78 million, net income was 1.1 million, net


income per diluted share was $0.06 and net income per diluted share excluding equity


compensation was $0.08. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 were approximately the same as


in the fourth quarter of 2005 while net income increased by 57%.


Under the accounting rules that went into effect on January 1, 2006, fourth quarter net income


includes 195,000 after-tax non-cash charge for equity compensation or $0.01 per diluted share. Net


income in the fourth quarter was favorably affected by an increase in the proportion of solutions


revenue to approximately 31% of total revenue compared to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2005.


Additionally, cost for employee benefit expenses were lower than anticipated in the fourth quarter of


2006 and several solutions projects were completed in the fourth quarter with more favorable than


anticipated results.


Revenues from IBM were at 23.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to 29 million in


the fourth quarter of 2005. Quarterly revenues from our European operations were 16.1 million in


the 2006 fourth quarter, a 31% increase from the 12.3 million recorded in last year’s fourth quarter.


Foreign exchange fluctuations accounted for approximately 10% of the 31% increase in our


European revenues in the quarter. The company had approximately 3,300 employees at end of


2006, of which approximates 87% are billable resources.


On the balance sheet, our day’s sales outstanding decreased to 63 days from 85 days at the end of


2005. This was largely a result of our change to a cash discount option for a significant customer in

the first quarter of 2006. Our cash provided by operations was approximately 262,000 in the


quarter. We had 430,000 in capital expenditures and we recorded depreciation expense 669,000.


During the fourth quarter of 2006 while adhering to SEC imposed volume limitations, we


repurchased 152,000 shares of CTG common stock. The repurchases in the fourth quarter were


made at an average price of $4.40 per share. As indicated in our earnings release, our Board of


Directors increased our authorization to repurchase the CTG stock by an additional 1 million


shares. We expect to continue our repurchase program in the first quarter of 2007. Jim?


James Boldt, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman


Thanks Brendan. First I would like to say that we’re pretty pleased with our fourth quarter results.


Despite the fact that we had an over $5 million reduction in revenues from IBM from last year’s


fourth quarter resulting from the decline in the staffing needs in the 2006 third quarter, our fourth


quarter revenues were approximately the same as last year as we replaced the IBM reduction with


increased revenue from other clients.


As the new revenue hit a higher concentration of solutions business that helped to push our


operating margins up, when you add that to the lower employee benefit cost in a few large projects


then unfavorably you get the highest quarterly earnings per share that the company has recorded


since in 1999. Obviously, with the $5 million reduction of the IBM business our strategic staffing


business declined overall when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We are seeing more of


our customers refine their IT staffing procurement processes by reducing their IT staffing providers


from hundreds to 5 to 15 vendors. Given the delivery structure that we have developed we are


doing an exceptionally well at making the new shrive [ph] list of IP services providers. The transition


of this work from previous vendors takes time, as most customers want to retain existing resources


from their displaced vendors until their projects end. Going forward, we do see this trend of fewer


vendors accelerating which bodes well for our long-term growth prospects for our strategic staffing


group.


On the solutions side of the business, we continue to see an increase in demand for some of our


high-growth solutions that we have focused on; areas of greatest demand continue to include


testing and information security in our financial services and general industry markets. In our


healthcare vertical, which includes our hospital, health insurers, and life insurance, life sciences


business, demand continues to be strong for consulting, clinical transformation projects, transitional


outsourcing and testing. We see a lot of opportunity for our healthcare vertical both in Europe and


US. And in 2007 we are investing in additional offerings, more healthcare sales territories and


additional sales staff in order to capitalize on our market position.


With respect to the national healthcare system project in UK, the project is progressing at a slower


than expected pace. We have, however, been placing additional staff on the project and expected


to do so throughout 2007. As a result of our US and UK healthcare practice, we have begun work in


Europe to assist the European software company with our development of hospital related software


package.


In the first quarter of 2007, we are forecasting revenues in the range of 79 to $81 million, slightly


above the level of our fourth quarter revenues. Given the revenue forecast, the investments we are


making and some additional expenses that occur in the first quarter of the year, we expect that our


first quarter GAAP net income will be in the $0.05 to $0.07 per diluted share range. Our guidance


includes a gain of approximately $0.02 per share from the sale of securities as well as a $0.01 per


share in non-cash expense for equity compensation.


As for the full year, we believe that CTG’s 2007 revenues will be in the range of 336 to $346 million,


3 to 6% above 2006 revenues. It is noteworthy that we expect to see revenue growth in 2007
