MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter Four 2004 Pinnacle


Airlines Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Raika [ph] and I will be your


coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be conducting a


question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [operator instructions] As a


reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would


now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Philip Trenary, Chief


Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir.


Philip Trenary, CEO


Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings Conference Call of


Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. On behalf of the more than 3,200 employees of Pinnacle, I would


like to thank you for interest in our company. This call is being presented live over the Internet via


web cast from our corporate website www.nwairlink.com. It will also be available on our website for


the week after this call.


This presentation contains various forward-looking statements that are based on management's


beliefs, as well as assumptions made by the information currently available to management.


Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements


are reasonable and can give no such assurance that such expectations will prove to have been


correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including


those set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available to


investors at our website or online from the Commission. Should one or more of these risks or


uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove erroneous, actual results may


vary materially from results that were anticipated or projected. The company does not intend to


update these forward-looking statements before its next filing with the Securities and Exchange


Commission.


Now one of the very positive events that we had at Pinnacle Airlines in the fourth quarter was


having Peter Hunt join us as our new Chief Financial Officer. Peter has been here, going into the


second week of December, has been here less than 2 months when he spearheaded the


successful convertible bond offering that was completed very recently. So with that I'm going to


turn it over to Peter Hunt, our Chief Financial Officer.


Peter Hunt, CFO


Thanks, Phil, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Pinnacle reported this morning


fourth quarter 2004 fully diluted earnings per share of 47 cents, a slight increase of 2 cents over the


fourth quarter 2003. We flew 1.3 billion ASMs, available seat miles, during the quarter, which was


an increase of 57% over the fourth quarter of 2003. Our block hours during the quarter were


95,834, which was an increase of 55% year-over-year, and our cycles increased 35% year-over-


year to 56,338. Our stage length for the quarter was up 19% to an average stage length of 482


miles and added 8 CRJs to the fleet during the quarter to end the year with 117 aircraft and our


fleet. Looking at the income statement, our total revenue was up 43% during the quarter to $181.3


million. Our operating income during the quarter was $17.5 million, essentially unchanged from the


fourth quarter of 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, in connection with the company's initial


public offering, we revised our target margin under the airlines services agreement from 14% to


10%. Had been the target margin been 10% during the fourth quarter of 2003, our operating

income actually would have been up 27% year-over-year, and our operating margin during the


fourth quarter was 9.7%.


Net income for the quarter was $10.3 million, up 5% over the fourth quarter of 2003. Our fourth


quarter results were negatively impacted by a severe winter weather operational disruption that we


had in December. We had the unusual unique event of winter storms impacting all 3 hubs over a


period of just a few days, affecting over 60% of the airports that we serve. Our ability to recover


quickly from these storms and get back to normal operations was impacted by limitations in some


of our scheduling systems. As a result, we continued to have cancellations and delays for several


days after the weather event.


We had already identified these limitations, and we had included plans in our 2005 capital plan,


which was approved by our board back in November to implement upgrades to those systems.


We've begun to implement those upgrades in the first quarter, and we've also identified interim


policies and strategies should we again face major winter weather disruptions over a significant


portion of our system.


Under our Airline Services Agreement with Northwest, we have several performance targets that


are measured over 6 month periods. Our December performance was a factor in missing 2 of


those goals for the 6 months ended December 31. We missed the goal for the percentage of


completed flights, and the percentage of on-time arrivals. As a result, we incurred performance


penalties of approximately $1.4 million pre-tax or 4 cents per share after adjusting for income taxes.


That $1.4 million was treated as a reduction in revenue on our fourth quarter income statement.


In addition to those penalties, we estimate that lost revenue from flight cancellations, and increased


passage re accommodation costs reduced operating income during the quarter by approximately


$1 million. Looking at the full-year 2004, our fully diluted earnings per share was $1.86 an increase


of 16% year-over-year. We flew 4.2 billion available seat miles during 2004, which was an increase


of 58% over 2003. Our block hours for 2004 were 324,000, up 54% over 2003; and our cycles for


the year were approximately 202,000, an increase of 37% over 2003.


We added 41 CRJs to the fleet during 2004, which was an increase of 54% of our fleet size, and


again we ended the year at 117 aircraft.


Total revenue in 2004 was $635.4 million, up 39% over 2003, and our operating income for the


year was $67.3 million, a slight increase of 5% over 2003. And again, if the 10% target margin had


been in place under our ASA during 2003, operating income would have increased 46% year-over-


year.


Our full-year operating margin was 10.6% which exceeded our target margin under our Airline


Services Agreement of 10% by 0.6 points, and our 2004 net income was $40.7 million, an increase


of 16% over 2003.


Looking at cash flow we ended the year with $34.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash


flow from operations for the year was $38 million. We used $17.6 million in cash from investing


activities, that's made up of capital expenditures of approximately $8.6 million. A payment in


Northwest in the fourth quarter in relation to increasing aircraft under our Airline Services


Agreement of $10 million, offset by $1 million in proceeds from the sale of some loadable inventory


earlier in the year.


Our cash flow used in financing activities was $17 million, and that consists of $12 million of


payments on our long-term note payable to Northwest and $5 million in payments under our


revolving credit agreement with Northwest.
