MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Trailer Bridge 2010 First Quarter Conference


Call. At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and that all


participants are currently in a listen-only mode.


I will now turn the conference over to Ivy Suter, Chief Executive Officer of Trailer Bridge.


Ivy Barton Suter, Chief Executive Officer


Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today’s remarks are prefaced with the usual


safe harbor language. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the


Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are not


guarantees of future performance and involve the usual risks and uncertainties. Among those risks


are those listed in our press release of yesterday.


With us on the call this morning are Trailer Bridge’s Chief Financial Officer, Mark Tanner and our


Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Bill Gotimer.


Our 2010 first quarter financial results show continued improvement in operating income of 23.8%


and an EBITDA of 12.4% over prior year. Net loss in this first quarter was reduced to 308,000 from


768,000 in the first quarter of 2009. These 2010 results include legal expenses of 380,000 as well


as non-cash option, amortization expense of 226,000 which together represent an expense


increase of 220,000 over prior year.


We are very pleased to report our dismissal with prejudice from the class action lawsuit related to


alleged anti-competitive activity in the Puerto Rico marine trade and a ruling by non-final order from


the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.


Our total revenue was 28.8 million for the quarter up 14% over prior year. Utilization in our


southbound liner service was soft in January and February, but improved significantly in March,


where we saw the results of account growth, which continued into April and into this current month.


This growth has resulted in volumes that were higher than those in both sequential and prior


periods representing increases of 2% and 18% respectively.


From a headwinds perspective, fuel prices were significantly higher year-over-year and yields


decreased approximately 5% over prior period due to pricing pressure in the Puerto Rico market.


Our Dominican Republic service continues to complement our vessel utilization in both directions.


CapEx estimates for 2010 continue to be in the $6 million range and our cash generation remains


strong.


I’ll now turn it over to Mark Tanner, who will take us through the financials. Mark?


Mark A. Tanner, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Ivy. As Ivy mentioned, our total revenue was 28.8 million for the quarter up 3.5 million


or 14% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to a solid 18% overall volume increase, which is


partially offset by a 5% decrease in overall yield. Southbound volume on an equivalent unit basis


was the highest achieved in the company’s 18-year history during what is normally the slowest


quarter of the year.


Revenue was up in all major categories and in both directions. Fuel surcharge revenue was up 1


million or 31% and charter hire revenue was up 400,000 or 46%. Freight revenue, net of fuel

surcharges is up 2.5 million or 12% comprised of an 11% increase in southbound revenue and a


19% increase in northbound. The decline in yield versus the prior period in most of the freight


category southbound is led by a 2.2% decline in yield on container freight and a 23% decline for


new vehicles.


Sequentially compared to the seasonally strong fourth quarter revenue was lower by 1.9 million or


6% – 9% decline in yield that is partially offset by a 2% improvement in overall volume. The volume


increases were led by a 3.8% improvement in southbound container volume and a 53% increase in


used vehicle volume. The increase in used vehicle volume is driven substantially by the Dominican


Republic service. The southbound yield decline sequentially was 2.4% in the core container


category and 25.8% for new vehicles. Northbound revenue was flat sequentially with a slight


decrease and volume offset by a 1.8% yield improvement.


Our capacity utilization is measured on vessel capacity deployed and for the first quarter is 96.5%


southbound and 30.2% northbound comparing favorably to both 84.7 and 25.5% levels reached in


the prior period and the 92.0 and 29.8% level reached in the fourth quarter. The net capacity


offered during the first quarter was actually 2.7% higher than the prior year due to two more TBC


sailings combined with container spaces gained by reconfiguring the vehicle-decking on the RO/RO


barges. There were only 12 southbound RO/RO vessel sailings in the first quarter as the first one of


the year was canceled due to the reduced holiday volume. Utilization would have been 92.1%,


28.9% for the southbound and northbound respectively assuming the same volume over the


additional RO/RO capacity.


Operating income for the quarter is 2.2 million, an improvement of 430,000 or 24% over the same


period last year driven primarily by the strong revenue performance and no dry-docking expense.


Other than the expected increases in volume related to marine and inland expense, fuel expense


was up by 1 million or 29% on higher average fuel prices with consumption remaining flat.


Sequentially, operating income declined 1.4 million on lower revenue due to lower overall yield and


increases in the volume related to marine and inland variable expenses. Fuel also increased by


157,000 or 3.7% sequentially primarily from a 9% increase in average price per gallon on slightly


lower consumption.


The net fuel cost for the first quarter which is our measure of actual fuel expense represented on


the income statement plus an estimate of the fuel costs embedded in our outside transportation


expense, less our actual fuel surcharge revenue, is 1.5 million a 2.3% improvement sequentially but


$800,000 or 119% higher than the prior year period.


The increase in fuel prices that began trending up during the middle of the last year continued into


the first quarter. We implemented two fuel surcharge rate increases during the quarter, one in early


January and the other in late March. The net fuel expense for April is 384,000 which is a level much


closer to our $1 million quarterly run rate target.


Sequentially net fuel expense is down 2.3%. The 9% increase in surcharge revenue more than


offset the increase in fuel expense. The fuel expense recovery rate for the first quarter is 73%


versus 71% sequentially and 82% for last year. The operating ratio for the quarter is 92.3% a slight


improvement over the 92.9% for the prior year period, but off 4% sequentially. The net loss for the


quarter is 308,000 a $460,000 or 60% improvement over the prior year period but $1 million off


sequentially.


The net loss per share for Q1 is $0.03 up $0.04 per share over the prior year period but down $0.11


per share sequentially. Adding back the 380,000 of legal expenses related to the DOJ investigation,


net income would be 72,000 and earnings per share would be $0.01.
