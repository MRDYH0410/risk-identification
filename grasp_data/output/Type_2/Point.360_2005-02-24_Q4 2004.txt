Thank you for joining us today. With me is Alan Steel, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we


answer any questions you may have regarding this press release, I would ask Alan to discuss


forward-looking statements and to briefly review the numbers that were released this morning.

considered to be in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we believe that this


information is useful to investors. So please refer to the news release for a full reconciliation of


non-GAAP amounts to those presented in accordance with GAAP.


Hopefully, you have all seen the press release, so I will only cover a few highlights. For all periods


presented, the effects of the IVC acquisition and special write-offs have been show separately to


make comparisons easier. Sales for the quarter were about 17.5 million, generating net income of


.8 million, or $0.08 per share, about the same as last year. Gross margin was 6.6 million in the


fourth quarter, up from 5.9 million last year. For the entire 2004 fiscal year, sales were 63.3 million,


slightly less than last year, generating about 22.8 million of gross margin. Net income for all of


2004 was 1.9 million, or $0.20 per share before special charges; and after the special charge, net


income was 1.2 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to last year’s 3.1 million, or $0.33 per share.


EBITDA for the fourth quarter was 3.2 million compared to 3.4 million last year. And for the year,


EBITDA before special charges was 9.8 million versus 13.9 million last year. You will notice that


our interest expense declined significantly in 2004 due to a debt restructuring. Our total debt at the


end of the year was about $21 million, including amounts borrowed to acquire IVC and purchase


and improve the media center. Haig will talk a little more about these items in his comments.


Haig?


Haig S. Bagerdjian, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Alan. In calendar 2004, we took major steps to prepare the Company for a better


future. We enhanced our financial strength and flexibility. We created value-added differentiators


and operational efficiencies. We made a strategic acquisition. We invested significantly in


upgrading our personnel.


In March 2004, we entered into a new revolving credit and term loan agreement with our two banks.


The available credit was then extended and current with the July 2004 IVC acquisition. We are


currently discussing a further extension of the agreement. We also established a new banking


relationship when we purchased the media center building in August 2004. While we incurred


about 6.4 million of mortgage debt for the real property purchase, the total debt service will be less


than the rental payment had we continued the building lease.


To put Point.360’s debt structure in perspective, our total net current and long-term bank


borrowings, debt less cash on hand, was 8.7 million at December 31st, 2003. During 2004, we


made 2.3 million scheduled principal payments, reducing the amount to 6.4 million. We then


borrowed 4.7 million to finance the acquisition of IVC. Without the impact of the media center


project financing on our debt structure, our total term borrowings as of December 31, 2004, would


have been about 11.1 million. Total net debt at December 31st, 2004, was about 21 million, after


including the 6.4 million mortgage and the media center down payment and improvement costs


financed through our line of credit.


Operationally, we’ll launch Point.360 in April. Point.360 enables our customers to host commercial


spots and then view, download, add media data, place order for distribution, monitor direct market


area information, and manage the digital and physical storage of the asset. In 2004, we also


completed the consolidation of our four storage facilities into our new state-of-the-art media center,


which will provide additional sales opportunities and eliminate duplicated costs.


On July 1, we completed the acquisition of IVC, which extended our service offering. On February


4, 2005, we acquired Sound Solutions, which added to our audio restoration capabilities. In late


2004, we enhanced our management team by adding industry-recognized sales and operational


professionals.
