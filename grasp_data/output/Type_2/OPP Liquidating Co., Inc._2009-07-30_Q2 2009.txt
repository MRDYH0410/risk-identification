Thanks, Keith. Welcome, fellow shareholders. I am Bob Snyder, President and Chief Executive


Officer of Orchids Paper Products. It’s great to speak with you again.


In the second quarter of 2009 we achieved net sales of over 24.1 million, up 8% from last year’s


second quarter, and record earnings of $0.55 per diluted share, a $0.41 increase over the second


quarter of 2008, a 393% improvement.


During the second quarter of 2009, major areas of interest were, in the paper manufacturing plant


we had paper making production in the second quarter of 2009 of 12,878 tons, a 10% decrease


over the same quarter of last year, and curtailing operations to adjust for parent roll sales is the


major reason for the decrease. In the converting plant we produced 1.8 million cases in the second


quarter, a 26% increase over the same quarter last year. We have record shipments in the second


quarter of over 1.7 million cases, a 17% improvement over the second quarter of 2008. The


company’s expansion project for the wastewater pre-treatment facility to reduce biological oxygen


demand and total suspended solids from its discharged water, on which we have previously


reported, is now operational.


We have completed a review of our logistics operations and our strategy of employing a third-party


warehouse. The review indicated a need to build a new warehouse facility of approximately

270,000 square feet, and eliminate the use of the third-party warehouse. To facilitate this project


we are in negotiations to purchase 20 acres of land adjacent to our existing converting plant. The


total cost of the project is estimated to be $8.4 million. Funding for this project will come from a


construction loan from our existing bank group and cash earnings.


We are also continuing to evaluate the feasibility of purchasing a new converting line to aid in our


strategy of increasing sales and profitability, and to consume all of our paper making production in


the converting operation. This project is expected to cost approximately $18 million. We are


encouraged by the positive impact and sustained improvements as a result of the coordinated


efforts of our management team and Orchids’ workforce over the past year, and look forward to


continued efforts and results in 2009. Now I will turn the call over to Keith to discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Bob. For the three months ended June 30, 2009 we set new quarterly records in net


sales, net income and EBITDA. Yesterday, we reported a quarterly record net income of $3.8


million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with net income of $887,000 or $0.14 per diluted


share in the same period of 2008. Year-to-date, our net income is 6.6 million or $0.97 per diluted


share compared with 1.5 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the first half of 2008. Net sales for the


second quarter of 2009 totaled 24.1 million, an increase of 8% over 22.3 million in net sales we


reported for the same period last year. This brings our year-to-date net sales to 47.8 million, an


increase of 12% over the 42.6 million reported for the same period in 2008. Net sales of converted


products in the second quarter of 2009 increased 30% to 22.5 million, which was primarily the


result of a 19% increase in net selling prices, and a 9% increase in tonnage shipped.


Improved production in our converting operations provided more converted product for sale, which


aided in our improvement in converted sales. The price increase we realized was primarily due to


product content changes and price increases taken during 2008 and early 2009. Net sales of


parent rolls decreased $3.3 million to 1.6 million, compared to 4.9 million in the same period of


2008. Parent rolls sales decrease due to a 58% increase in the tonnage shipped, and a 22%


decrease in net selling price. A soft parent roll market primarily due to the soft away from home


market and to a lesser extent the increased tonnage requirements for our converting operation are


the primary reasons for the lower parent rolls sales. We are pleased that the commitments we


made last year to improve our converting operation continue to pay off and help us in our drive


toward our goal of consuming all of our internally produced paper in our converting operation.


EBITDA in the second quarter of 2009 was a new quarterly record at 6.6 million, which was an


increase of 4.2 million over the 2.4 million reported in the same quarter of 2008. This was an


increase of 1.2 million over the previous record of 5.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2009.


As a percent of net sales, EBITDA was 27.3% in the 2009 quarter compared to 10.8% reported in


the second quarter of 2008. On a year-to-date basis our EBITDA increased by 7.5 million to $12


million compared to the 4.5 million of EBITDA reported for the same period in 2008. Our improved


results in the 2009 quarter were primarily the result of the increase in our net selling price per ton


for converted products, lower waste paper prices, the higher converted sales volumes, and lower


direct labor costs in our converting operation.


Our overall cost of paper decreased $172 per ton in the second quarter of 2009. The $642 per ton


compared to $814 per ton in the second quarter of 2008. A 49% reduction in our cost of waste


paper in the quarter-over-quarter comparison was the primarily reason for the lower production


costs. The lower waste paper costs improved earnings by approximately 2.6 million in the quarter.


Also affecting our cost of sales were lower converting direct labor costs, lower natural gas costs,


and higher converting overhead costs.
