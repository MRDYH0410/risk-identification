Ferdinand V. Lepere, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Well, good morning, and thank you for joining TBS International’s quarterly conference call. The


purpose of today’s call is to discuss the results of TBS’ fourth quarter and year ended December


31, 2010. Yesterday we issued a press release after the market closed in New York with financial


and operational information for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010. If you have


not received this release, you may log on to our website at www.tbsship.com and navigate to the


Investor Relations page, or you can call Capital Link at area code 212-661-7566. We will also post


the transcript of this call on our website once it has been prepared.


Our remarks today will be followed by a question-and-answer session. For those of you who want


to follow our slide presentation, please go to the TBS website, which again is www.tbsship.com,


and click on the webcast link. Note that the slides are user controlled. For those of you who want to


follow the webcast, please click on the arrow at the bottom of the webcast screen to make the


slides turn. Also, please note that the webcast will be archived on our website.


Now, I’d like you to please turn to slide number one. This slide refers to forward-looking statements.


During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements. Such


statements are just predictions and involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may


differ materially.


I would like to refer you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular


our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual reports on Form 10-K. These documents


contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from


those expressed in these forward-looking statements.


And, with that, I’d like to introduce Joseph Royce, our Chairman, CEO and President.


Joseph E. Royce, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Director


Thank you, Fred. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to TBS International’s conference call


for the results of the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010.


I’d like to begin our presentation with slide number two, the Baltic Indices. The TBS results for the


fourth quarter 2010 reflect the ongoing downward pressure on dry cargo freight rates that have


continued into the first quarter of this year, as evidenced by the Baltic Dry indices.

The Baltic Dry Index, or BDI, which was at 2,446 on September 30, 2010 descended to 1,773 on


December 24th, the last reporting day in 2010, and was at 1,559 on March 14, 2011.


Correspondingly, the Baltic Handysize Index, or BHSI, which was at 1,039 on September 30, 2010


descended to 829 on December 24th and was at 736 on March 14, 2011. A number of factors have


contributed to these circumstances. Of most importance is the continued drumbeat of the delivery


of new-built vessels in all four of the major vessel sizes; Capesize, Panamax, Supramax and


Handysize.


While cargo demand generally increased during most of 2010, numerous events over the last


several months have interrupted the availability of cargo, contributing to both the supply-demand


imbalance and the Asia-Americas imbalance. There has been severe floodings in Australia that has


interrupted shipments of coal, iron ore and wheat, along with government imposed restrictions on


the export of coal from Indonesia and iron ore from India, thereby causing deviation of vessels that


traditionally carried these cargoes from that region into the Atlantic.


As a consequence, TBS is operating at freight and charter rates that would cause us to fail to


comply with certain financial covenants in our credit facilities, even as recently modified, as soon as


June 30, 2011.


We are all aware of the terrible disaster that has affected Japan. I’m pleased to announce that all


TBS’ staff members are safe. We had two vessels in the area that were affected by the earthquake,


which one was slightly damaged. Japan is important part of our Pacific Service where we both load


and discharge cargoes. It is too soon to evaluate the impact of the recent tragic events in Japan.


Now I would like to turn the floor over to Fred Lepere, our Senior Executive Vice President and


Chief Financial Officer.


Ferdinand V. Lepere, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Joe. We should now all be on slide number three. This slide summarizes our fourth


quarter 2010 operating and financial highlights.


For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, total revenues were $100.8 million, an increase


of 19% over the same period in 2009. Voyage revenues for the three months ended December 31,


2010, was $75.6 million, an increase of 14% from the $66.6 million during the same period in 2009.


Time charter revenues for the fourth quarter 2010 increased by $5.7 million or 34% to $22.6 million


from $16.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009.


Our net loss for the fourth quarter 2010 was $217.4 million at the non-controlling interest, an


increase of $206.7 million compared with the net loss of $10.7 million during the same period last


year.


Earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis for the fourth quarter 2010 was a loss of $7.12 per


share as compared to a loss of $0.36 per share for the fourth quarter of last year.


I’d like to mention here that the increase in net loss and loss per share as compared to the same


period in 2009 is mainly attributable to a $201.7 million non-cash vessel impairment charge that we


recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding vessel impairment, net loss and earnings per


share for the three months ended December 31, 2010 would have been $15.7 million and a loss of


$0.51 per share respectively.


EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, was $20.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, an


increase of 5% over the same period in 2009. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2010 excludes the
