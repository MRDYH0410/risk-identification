MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the Quicksilver Resources Second Quarter Earnings Call.


[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Diane Weaver. Thank you.


Ms. Weaver, you may begin your conference.


Diane Weaver, Director of Investor Relations


Good morning. I’m Diane Weaver, Director of Investor Relations, and I would like to welcome you


to the Quicksilver Resources Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Release Conference Call. Company


management on the call today are Glenn Darden, President and CEO; Toby Darden, Chairman of


the Board, and Bill Lamkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Wayne Blair,


Vice President and Controller. We will begin today's call with Glenn Darden discussing the


company's operations, followed by Bill Lamkin who will give a review of the second quarter financial


results. We will then open the call to any questions that you might have. Before I turn the call over


to Glenn, I would like to remind you that this call is covered by the disclaimer in our Securities and


Exchange Commission filings. Glenn?


Glenn Darden, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Diane. Good morning. Quicksilver Resources earned $17.2 million or $0.21 per diluted


share for the second quarter of 2005. This compares to $0.10 per diluted share in the second


quarter of 2004, taking into account the 3-for-2 stock split in June of 2005, and $0.13 per share for


the prior quarter. Our production averaged 138 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the quarter.


The company is currently producing 144 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Quicksilver’s gas


production is up 21% year-over-year.


On the operational front, MGV, Quicksilver's Canadian subsidiary, has drilled 223 Horseshoe


Canyon coal wells thus far on a gross basis, 127 net. 63 of these wells are completed and should


be online very shortly. The rainy early summer has delayed our operations but we were on pace to


drill 490 gross wells, 280 net wells by year-end with daily net production exceeding 55 million cubic


feet per day by year-end. As we have discussed before, most of this year's drilling is north of the


Palliser Block in joint venture areas where we are seeing higher initial rates per well. The company


also drilled two Horizontal Manville coal tests this quarter and these wells are presently being


completed. Current production from Canada is 41 million cubic feet per day. We have 4 drilling


rigs running and 2 frac crews currently working with approximately 360 gross wells left to be added


to sales this year.


Quicksilver's Barnett Shale program continues to expand. The company has drilled 18 net wells or


22 gross wells so far this year; 12 of these wells have been completed this year and the company is


currently producing 13 million cubic feet equivalent per day. The company has 2 drilling rigs


running in the Barnett and we will add at least 3 more by year-end. Actually 2 of those rigs should


move in by the middle of September. The initial phase of the company's Cowtown pipeline system


was put in service in July and this 8-inch portion of the system is being twinned currently with a 20-


inch section. This will allow Quicksilver to flow to sales both gas and natural gas liquids in separate


lines. The NGL yield will increase significantly with the startup of our cryogenic processing plants –


that’s 75 million cubic feet a day processing plant – in the fourth quarter. The company's acreage


position has increased to approximately 230,000 net acres. This acreage primarily is running south


from the Hood-Johnson County line into Somervell and Bosque Counties and east into Hill County.


And we have now tested roughly 25 miles in a north-south direction and will be drilling test wells in


the outer edges of our acreage before year-end.

Quicksilver has also drilled 26 wells in Michigan and Indiana in our other shale projects. Our


Michigan production team has done an excellent job in working over non-Antrim properties and


have kept Michigan production ahead of target thus far this year. The company has assembled a


couple of sizable acreage blocks to test new unconventional plays and we are moving ahead with


plans for testing these ideas later this year and in the first half of ‘06. We are seeing consistency in


both of our major new development areas. No surprises in Canada. And we were becoming more


confident with each well we drill in the Barnett. We’re working hard on the logistics side to be


certain of rigs, services and supplies to accomplish our goals in these hot plays. Our Quicksilver


team is doing a great job in this effort.


Overall, we are very pleased with the progress so far this year and we look forward to building our


production volumes by expanding our drilling projects in the coming months. And now I would like


to turn the call over to Bill Lamkin, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the company's financial


results and will be available for any questions after his remarks. Bill?


Bill M. Lamkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Glenn. As Glenn mentioned, the earnings for the quarter were 17.2 million or $0.21 per


diluted share compared to 7.5 million for the same period in ’04, 10.8 million for the prior quarter


‘05. Gross revenues for the period were 68.5 million. That compares to 42 million in the same


quarter of ‘04, 55.2 million last quarter.


The non-GAAP measure of cash flow adjusted EBITDA which is net earnings before income taxes,


interest expense adjusted for non-cash charges and credits, was 43.4 million for the quarter. This


compares to 22.7 in the second quarter of ’04, and 32.2 in the first quarter of ‘05. A reconciliation


of EBITDA to GAAP is available on our website at qrinc.com.


Moving to production, our total production was 12.6 billion cubic feet equivalent or 138 million Mcfe


a day. This compares to a total of 10.7 Bcfe for the same period last year, 12.1 Bcfe for the prior


quarter of this year. Natural gas, including the natural gas liquids, continues to comprise


approximately 93% of the company’s total production. Natural gas production for the second


quarter was 11.4 Bcf or 125.6 million cubic feet a day versus a total of 9.4 Bcf in the second quarter


of ‘04, 11.1 Bcf in the first quarter of this year. Crude oil production for the quarter was 142,740


barrels; that equates to 1,569 barrels per day compared to 184,882 for the same quarter in ‘04, and


128,455 in the prior quarter. Natural gas liquids production for the period was 45,235 barrels, or


497 barrels per day. That’s versus 33,142 for the second quarter of ’04, 32,072 barrels for the first


quarter of this year. Production volumes for the third quarter of ‘05 should average in the range of


146 to 148 million cubic feet equivalent a day and average 170 million to 172 million cubic feet


equivalent per day for the fourth quarter. That means that our year-over-year production would be


– something over a 22% increase for the year.


Operating expenses for the quarter were 38.7 million; that compares to the total operating


expenses in the same period last year of 29.1 million and 35.5 last quarter. The quarterly expenses


were comprised of 17.9 million of LOE, 2.5 million production taxes, 654,000 other operating cost,


4.6 million G&A, 13 million DD&A and interest expense was 4.8 million. Our second quarter DD&A


run rate was $1.04 per Mcfe; that consists of $0.86 of depletion, $0.16 depreciation, $0.02 of


accretion.


During the second quarter, the G&A run rate was $0.37, which was $0.07 higher than planned.


The primary difference is totaling about a nickel were related to legal costs for corporate


governance and amendments to our various debt agreements and to booking of expense for the


headquarters staff and officer-restricted stock grants. Remaining $0.02 of difference was spread


over a number in a wide range of categories.
