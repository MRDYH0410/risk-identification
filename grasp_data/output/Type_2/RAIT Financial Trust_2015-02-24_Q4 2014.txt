Now, I'd like to turn the call over to RAIT's Chief Executive Officer, Scott Schaeffer. Scott?

Thank you, Andres. Good morning, everyone. RAIT is a hybrid REIT with a multi-strategy approach to investing based on commercial real estate lending, along with direct ownership and management of commercial real estate properties. This approach delivers diversification to the portfolio, blending the higher-yielding lending business with the stability and recurring income stream from owning and managing properties. Our investing approach is supported by our platform, which now comprised of over 725 employees managing over $4.3 billion of commercial real estate assets.

With most of the challenges faced in 2014 now behind us, we are looking forward to continued growth in all aspects of our business in 2015. We have exited the remaining Taberna business line by selling our collateral management contracts in the fourth quarter and our residual Taberna bond holdings early in the first quarter of 2015.

Due to the sale of these assets, we have deconsolidated the two remaining Taberna CDOs from RAIT's balance sheet. This deconsolidation was the primary driver of the non-cash GAAP loss recorded in the fourth quarter and should result in a more transparent and less volatile financial presentation going forward.

Let me talk about the results. CAD for the fourth quarter was $0.26 per share and $0.71 for the year, a 14% increase over 2013 CAD when adding back the one-time cost of the SEC settlement. During 2014, we experienced progress in our core business lines and our lending business gross loan originations were $983 million, a 63% increase over 2013 levels.

As we anticipated, competition increased in the fixed rate lending space, which when combined with market volatility resulted in lower spreads and lower gain on sale profits on an individual loan basis. Loan volumes in this business line were up modestly over 2013 to $459 million. We expect increased volume in 2015, which should mitigate the current lower-spread environment. Even with the increase in competition, yields within this business remained very attractive at more than 30% during 2014.

We made solid progress in our floating rate bridge lending program in 2014. Originations increased over 270% to $505 million when compared to 2013. Unlike the fixed rate originate-and-sell program, these loans are held on our balance sheet and generate recurring monthly interest income. The new floating rate bridge loans are financed short term on our warehouse facilities until we aggregate a [ph] sufficient-sized full loan (04:42) which are then financed with long-term, non-recourse, match-funded liabilities.

During 2014, RAIT sponsored two floating rate CMBS securitizations, issuing $337 million of investment grade notes collateralized by $415 million of loans. We retained a $78 million subordinate investment in these two securitizations, which we expect will deliver a high-teens return over the life of the collateral. We expect to increase the volume of our floating rate lending business in 2015 and are working to close our fourth floating rate securitization in the second quarter.

In our property portfolio, increases in direct investments in real estate and properties under management increased 70% to $1.7 billion when compared to 2013. The majority of the growth came from $497 million of multi-family acquisitions made through Independence Realty Trust during the year.

We also made opportunistic purchases of two retail centers as we see an opportunity to invest in retail property assets using the Urban Retail platform. We expect to generate strong recurring risk-adjusted returns and create another stable revenue stream for RAIT.

Rental income grew during the year through increased rental rates and property acquisitions. RAIT's multi-family portfolio experienced year-over-year same-store average rent growth of 4%.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for the financial report.

Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, 2014 was a transformative year for RAIT as we experienced growth in our core business activities and exited the legacy Taberna business. For the year, CAD was $57.5 million or $0.71 per common share. This included a $21.5 million charge for the previously announced settlement with the SEC. The $21.5 million settlement charge is recorded in the line item called other income and expense.

From a GAAP perspective, we are reporting an overall net loss of $319 million or $3.92 per share for the year ended December 31, 2014. This loss is primarily comprised of a $216 million loss we incurred on the deconsolidation of Taberna VIII and Taberna IX during December 2014.

As discussed during our third quarter conference call, we took steps to exit the Taberna business during the fourth quarter. This included selling the collateral management contracts on Taberna I, Taberna VIII and Taberna IX. That sale closed on December 19, and we deconsolidated Taberna VIII and Taberna IX on that day.

Through December 19, however, we continued to account for Taberna on a GAAP basis, including the accrual of income and expenses, as well as the regular, normal, fair value accounting for its assets, liabilities and hedges.

As it relates to the sale of the collateral management contracts, we recorded income of $4.5 million, net of severance and other costs associated with exiting the Taberna business.

Lastly, in January 2015 we sold the various bonds we held related to the Taberna business for proceeds of $20.4 million. In summary, we generated $24.9 million of additional capital from exiting the Taberna business.

In addition to the loss on deconsolidation of Taberna, our GAAP net loss for 2014 was also driven by the $99 million of changes in the fair value of our various financial instruments. With the deconsolidation of Taberna, this volatility will be removed from our future financial results.

Compared to 2013, our net interest margin was flat. There are several reasons for this, as follows: one, NIM from Taberna was down by $5.6 million in 2014; two, we had $164 million of loan payoffs in 2014, causing a reduction in NIM of $5.3 million; three, our 2014 floating rate loan production of $505 million and related financing costs provided – or increased NIM by $7.2 million; and finally during 2014, we had $3.7 million in reduced hedging costs associated with our loans when compared to 2013.

As we've discussed previously, the interest rates in our RAIT I and RAIT II securitizations are continuing to burn off. Based on the current one-month LIBOR curve, we expect to see $8 million of reduced hedging costs during 2015 when compared to 2014 as hedges continued to expire according to their terms.

Keep in mind that our CRE CDO notes and related hedges [indiscernible] (09:00) both third-party loans and some of our own real estate assets. As such, the total savings of $8 million expected in 2015 will be seen through an improvement in NIM and reduced interest expense.

From a credit perspective, our CRE non-accrual loans decreased to $25 million during 2014 and represent about 1.8% of our loan portfolio at year-end. This decrease during 2014 was related to two loans totaling $9 million that were charged off, one loan for $8 million that was deconsolidated with Taberna, and that was offset by $5.5 million of net additions to non-accrual status.

Our current loan loss reserves are $9.2 million or 37% of our non-accrual loans and we believe that our reserves are adequate.

Rental income increased by 42% or $48.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. This increase is primarily a result of $45.8 million of rental income associated with 32 properties acquired during 2014 and those present for a full year in 2014. The growth in new properties is primarily driven by the growth of Independence Realty Trust. During 2014, IRT acquired 20 properties for an aggregate cost of $497 million. The remaining increase of $2.3 million in rental revenue is due to continued improvement in rental rates across the same-store properties.

Lastly, fee and other income was $24.3 million in 2014 and was comprised of the following: $9.5 million of CMBS loan sale profitability, $13 million of property management revenue, $1 million of asset management fees, and $700,000 of other fee income.

With respect to our expenses, a couple items of note. Interest expense this year is up $15.1 million compared to 2013 due primarily to $8.7 million of interest associated with mortgages used to finance the properties acquired during 2014 and those mortgages present for a full year this year. The remaining increase in interest expense of $6.4 million resulted from our issuances of $132 million of senior unsecured notes during 2014 and the amortization of associated debt issuance costs.

Property operating expenses increased by $20.7 million this year as compared to 2013. Of this increase, $20 million is the result of the 32 properties acquired during 2014 and those present for a full year. Operating expenses in the same-store portfolio increased $600,000, primarily because of increased real estate taxes.

Overall, the net operating income of our real estate portfolio is $80.7 million this year, an increase of $27.4 million from last year. On a same-store basis, NOI this year increased 3.7% from 2013.

Compensation and general administrative costs ended the year at $45.8 million or 16% of our total revenue. While these are costs are up $4.5 million, they are down from 17% of total revenue in 2013.

With respect to our CRE CDOs, we continue to meet all over-collateralization tests. CRE CDO I reported an OC test of 127%, above the required level of 116%. CRE CDO II reported an OC test of 121%, above the required level of 112%. These OC tests are largely unchanged compared to year-end 2013.

As of quarter-end, we continue to maintain good liquidity for investment. We accessed the capital markets three times in 2014 at RAIT, issuing common equity and two rounds of senior unsecured bonds raising gross proceeds of $214.5 million.

Additionally, Independence Realty Trust completed three common shares [indiscernible] (12:50) 2014. In total, IRT issued 22.1 million common shares and raised $201 million of gross proceeds during 2014. All of these proceeds have been invested.

RAIT continues to externally manage IRT and currently owns 23% of IRT's outstanding common stock.

Scott, this concludes the financial report. Back to you.

Thank you, Jim. As we look out over 2015, we see opportunities to continue growing both fixed rate and floating rate loan origination volumes with the goal of originating $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of loans during 2015. We also expect to continue adding multi-family properties to IRT's portfolio and to make property acquisitions through the Urban Retail platform.

Additionally, we have begun marketing a number of RAIT-owned properties for sale with a focus on the multi-family portfolio, as we see opportunities to generate solid gains in the current environment.

And, operator, at this time, I'd like to open the call up for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve DeLaney, representing JMP Securities. Please proceed.

Thank you. Good morning, guys, and congratulations on the Taberna exit. I must say the year-end balance sheet is certainly easier on the eyes than the September one.

Just to touch on the Taberna exit, I just want to make sure I understand what happened in January. You'd already sold the management contracts, but you sold the residual interests. Did you sell all of the residual interests in that transaction or do you still own some bonds?

We sold all of the bonds. We still hold the preferred equity class and they'll be disposed off early in 2015.

Okay, got it. Thanks for clarifying that.

From a value standpoint, there is no value there.

I got it , okay. And the proceeds of $20.4 million, did that simply recover your carrying value or was there possibly a gain related to that transaction?

Well, the carrying value was – let's say, the carrying value was – the face value of the bonds was significantly higher than $20.4 million.

Oh, correct, yes.

That's right.

But you – in other words, the sales proceeds was roughly equal to where you were carrying those at fair value?

Correct, yes.

Okay, got it. But it did – you made the point, I believe, that you freed up $24 million, $25 million of actual capital out of the transaction.

That's right.

Okay. And related to that, I know that you were, or through the holidays and earlier this year, trying to work with the folks of the SEC just to finalize your agreement with them that you have entered into in September. Can you comment as to whether that has been finalized at this point?

It has not been finalized at this point. We are at the mercy of the SEC. They will be providing the first draft of the settlement agreement, and they have not provided it to us at this time. I will tell you, however, that all of the changes that we made within RAIT exiting the Taberna business, the exiting or separation with the two officers, all of that had been communicated to the SEC as it was happening and they had no comments. So, they're fully aware of what we've done. We're just waiting on them to provide the settlement agreement.

Got it, okay. Thank you for that, Scott. That's helpful. And just one final thing for me. Jim, you mentioned that your ownership at IRT is 23%. For modeling purposes, for at least for 2015, should we just assume going forward that IRT's multi-family assets will continue to be consolidated on to the RAIT balance sheet?

Through 2015, correct, yes, I would.

Okay, very good. Thank for the comments, guys.

Thank you, Steve.

Your next question comes from the line of Lucy Webster, representing Compass Point. Please proceed.

Hey, good morning. It's Jason here. A couple of questions. Scott, if you could elaborate on the property sales, I'm assuming these are the properties financed via CRE CDO I or CRE CDO II. What happens to the proceeds when you do sell a property in those portfolios?

There are three properties that we've identified. It's a 1,000 units. They all have senior debt that is not held by RAIT, that is maturing in the near term, and there is some minor amount of RAIT mezzanine debt still held in the CDOs. So the proceeds, obviously, will go to pay off the CDOs and it will reduce or pay off CDO bonds 100% relative to that mezz debt. The senior loans will be paid off to the third parties, and then the value in excess of those debt balances will be held by RAIT.

Okay. So, you do get the excess, but that does not go to pay down any additional CDO debt?

No...

No.

...because the CDO liabilities will be paid in full relative to the CDO exposure.

Got it. And you said three properties, 1,000 units. Is that, I guess, a near-term event we should expect and is it something that could continue throughout the year? Is this more of a strategic push or just opportunistic near term?

We are looking towards a second quarter transaction. It is opportunistic relative to the market environment that we're in, but we are expecting this to be the first of a number of sales.

Great, thank you. And then in the – I mean the trends in terms of occupancy and rent growth were particularly strong in the fourth quarter, especially in office and retail. How much of that trend should we expect to continue? I know it can be a little bumpy, but that certainly was much stronger than we had modeled. Anything you can give us to think about how that should trend going throughout the year?

I think it should continue to trend well. It takes a little bit longer, as we've always said, to stabilize the office and retail portfolio rather than a multi-family. But we're making good progress. And we think that the properties are well positioned to continue to experience higher occupancy rates and, hopefully, lease rates or rental rates.

Great. One last one for me and then I'll jump out. In the Conduit business, was there any particular loan that depress the gain on sale or was it – I know sometimes you can have timing because of spreads – or is that really a good run rate for where the competitive environment has pushed margins?

I think, first, let me just say that we were a victim of our own success. Really, our spreads were much wider than the market as a whole previously because the market wasn't focused on smaller loans. So what we've seen is, spreads on those smaller loans come in as more and more competition moved into that space.

As you know, it is somewhat volatile. The spreads change almost daily. Right now, we're seeing a little bit of an increase spread environment here in the first quarter, leading into the second quarter than what we saw late in the fourth quarter of last year. But it's anyone's guess if that spread environment will continue.

Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.

Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani, representing KBW. Please proceed.

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. On the competitive environment for lending, beyond the conduit market that you cited, where are you seeing the greatest amount of competition and where do you think you continue to have a niche or an advantage?

Well, I think the competition is across-the-board. Cleary, in the conduit space, the originated for sale program, there's more competition just because it's less capital-intensive. But let's be clear, there is competition everywhere.

Our niche really is the relationships that we've developed and maintained over 18 years or 19 years and just the reputation of being able to deliver. And as you can see, we had a big increase in volume last year and we expect another sizable increase in volume this year based upon our early projections.

So, our niche is just knowing what we do. There are barriers-to-entry. You can't just jump into this business; you have to have the capital, the know-how and the relationships. And we've been doing it for a long time and we have the capital to continue this growth.

The floating rate business is really our bread-and-butter. We see a big opportunity to continue to originate good, well-positioned and strong credit loans and to securitize them in the floating rate CMBS. We were one of the early movers in that space. We've closed three of those deals. Now, it becomes like clockwork. And as we've said, we expect to have our fourth one done in the second quarter of this year.

Regarding the floating rate business, have you seen just sequentially any, either, spread widening or would you say competition has offset that, and so perhaps spreads have either remained flat or compressed slightly?

Spreads have come in on both the liabilities and on the pricing. So our spread has been – we've been able to maintain it and we expect that to continue.

And regarding the CMBS volatility, has there been any notable impact on floating rate issuance? Do you think pricing on this forward-securitization based on what you know today would be similar to past deals or do you think it could be improved upon?

I would expect it to be improved upon.

Okay. Do you guys plan to continue to report FFO and AFFO? I don't believe they were disclosed this quarter.

We do not plan to continue to present AFFO, simply because that was affected by the Taberna business and included the NIM on Taberna. So, we're going to be removing that going forward and we will still be reporting FFO in the K when it's published.

Okay. Can you disclose FFO for this quarter?

Sure. Fourth quarter was a loss of $2.97, because of the Taberna deconsolidation, obviously.

And then, do you have that excluding the Taberna deconsolidation?

I do not have it in front of me, but I can...

Okay.

...call you back with that.

Okay. And then just finally, the comment around investment capacity. Can you – I mean, do you mind just providing some color on current investment capacity and also targeted financial leverage?

We ended the year with $122 million of cash in the balance sheet. And we generated proceeds coming from the bonds as well from the bond sale and are currently – we're expecting continued leverage in the floating rate business of approximately 80%. Once it's match...

Great. Thanks for...

...once it's match-funded 80% leverage on the floating rate business, the warehousing advances 50%

Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

You're welcome. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eckert, representing MLV & Company. Please proceed.

Good morning and thanks for taking my call.

Good morning.

I just had a quick question on the origination. In the last two or three quarters, there appeared to be a significant [ph] slip-back (25:27) toward the Conduit business. Are you expecting – what kind of mix are you expecting in 2015 between your floating rate and fixed rate businesses?

We're modeling a 50/50 split.

Okay. All right, fair enough. Thank you very much.

You're welcome. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Stolzar, representing Pyrrho Capital Management. Please proceed.

Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question.

Hi, Matthew.

In 2014, you paid out roughly all of your CAD in dividend, and that CAD was inclusive of taking a $0.26 charge. So, how should we think about your targeted payout ratio going forward?

Previously, we've targeted 75% of CAD for the dividend. And, yes, clearly in 2014, that was impacted by the SEC settlement. The board looks at the dividend payout every quarter and we really don't have a formal policy.

Okay, thank you.

Thank you.

With no further questions at this time, I would now like to hand the call back to Mr.

Scott Schaeffer for any closing remarks.

Thank you, operator. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter. Thank you.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.
