MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: My name is David, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like


to welcome everyone to the Ebix.com 2008 Fourth Quarter Investor Conference Call. All lines have


been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a


question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.


I would like to now turn the call over to President of Ebix, Mr. Raina. You may begin your call, sir.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for attending Ebix 2008 annual investor


conference call. I have also with me today Mr. Robert Kerris, Ebix CFO, on this investor conference


call.


We announced our 2008 financial results on Friday last week, and all of you must have seen those


numbers by now. I will take a few minutes to summarize these results for you. Each of the last few


years has been a record year for Ebix, in terms of beating all its results in the last 33 years. This


year was no different from the last few to the extent that the financial results for the year 2008 are


record results again, the best ever in our 33-year young history.


Ebix total revenue rose 74% to $74.75 million in 2008, compared to $42.84 million in 2007. Ebix


operating income rose 129% to $29.26 million in fiscal 2008, compared to operating income of 12.8


million in 2007. In 2008, the company’s net income rose 116% to 27.31 million, or $2.28 per diluted


share, compared to net income of $12.67 million or $1.20 per diluted share in 2007. Our operating


margins continued to improve, increasing to 39% for 2008 from 30% in 2007. Net margins for the


full year of 2008 grew to 37% versus 30% in the full year of 2007.


For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the company generated $26.79 million of net


cash flow from operating activities, compared to 14.4 million for the year ended December 31,


2007, a 78% increase in operating cash flows year-over-year. In 2008, the company’s basic


earnings per common share rose to $2.78 as compared to basic earnings per common share of


$1.36 in 2007. Results for 2008 and 2007 were based on 9.81 [sic] [9.84] and 9.31 million weighted


average basic shares outstanding, respectively.


Ebix’s 2008 fourth quarter revenue rose 65% to 20.14 million, compared to 12.2 million during the


fourth quarter of ‘07. Q4 ‘08 net income rose 76% to 7.91 million or $0.66 per diluted share versus


Q4 ‘07 net income of 4.5 million or $0.40 per diluted share. Results for Q4 ‘08 and Q4 ‘07 were


based on 12.29 and 11.33 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Our


net margins grew to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus 37% in the fourth quarter of 2007.


The sudden strengthening of the US dollar had a clear impact on our revenue numbers in Q4 of


‘08, since we convert all international results into US dollars for reporting purposes. For example,


our Q4 2008 results would have been approximately $2 million higher if the exchange rates had not


strengthened so appreciably since June 2008.


Our revenue in 2008 was split across the four channels that we focus on. The largest percentage


was in the area of exchanges with a 57% share; broker channel had 19%; carrier channel had 12%;


and the BPO channel had 11% of our 2008 revenues. We expect this composition to change a bit


in 2009, with exchanges and BPO channel constituting a larger percentage of our revenues in ‘09.


In the year 2008, the US accounted for 65% of the revenues, while international accounted for 35%


of the revenues. This was very much on the lines predicted earlier.

I am often asked about our guidance on future quarters and years. We have always believed in


letting our past performance and numbers speak for themselves, and thus, I’ll abstain from issuing


any guidance or numbers. For those of you who have been investors in Ebix stock for some time,


you have heard me say this many a times earlier. I am not going to depart from that thought


process and issue a future guidance. Instead, I will lay out a few metrics from the past three years,


as I do every year, for you to discover an answer for yourself.


Let’s look at three measures over the last few years: revenue, net income, and diluted EPS. Ebix


2008 fourth quarter revenue rose 65% to 20.1 million compared to fourth quarter revenue in ‘07 of


12.2 million, fourth quarter revenue in 2006 of 9.28 million, and fourth quarter revenue in 2005 of


6.16 million. Our revenues in 2008 grew 74% as compared to 2007, grew 155% as compared to


2006, and grew 210% as compared to 2005. Ebix 2008 net income in 2008 grew 116% over 2007,


358% as compared to 2006, and 532% as compared to 2005. Ebix diluted EPS for 2008 grew 90%


year-over-year to $2.28, 218% as compared to 2006, 341% as compared to 2005. If you looked at


the year 2008 itself, each sequential quarter was an improvement over the previous quarter in the


year.


I am often asked whether the Ebix net margins of 35%-plus are sustainable. Our belief has always


been that a business in which a selling price is a lot higher than the cost price is a viable business.


A few years back, we publicly announced our goal of getting to a net margin of 30%-plus.


Consequently, these margins today are a result of meticulous planning, centralized cost control


processes, effective utilization of offshore resources, and a rather simple approach to business that


requires income growth to be directly proportional to revenue growth. Our net margins have


continued to grow since -- in the last few years. Our net margins are 11% in 2004, 18% in 2005,


20% in 2006, 30% in 2007, and 37% in 2008. In the year 2008 itself, if you were to examine the


quarters, our net margins are 34% in Q1, 36% in Q2, 37% in Q3, and 39% in Q4. These numbers


speak for themselves. While we cannot guarantee that these margins are sustainable, yet our


attempt is certainly going to be to live up to the benchmarks defined by us.


As a part of my job, I keep speaking to a broad spectrum of investors across the world. Based on


interactions with them and the fact that we have a number of new investors on the call, I felt it


important to proactively address some questions that you might have as regards the company.


Some of these questions and answers might appear repetitive to some of our older investors. But


as I said, we have got a few new investors on the call, and I felt it would be useful to have those


questions.


So let’s start with the first question. What is Ebix vision plan? Ebix goal is to be the leading back-


end powerhouse of insurance transactions in the world. The company’s technology vision is to


focus on convergence of all insurance channels, processes, and entities in a manner that data can


seamlessly flow once a data entry has been made. We intend to do that by designing products and


services that are pioneering and are at least a few years ahead of our competition. We believe that


profitability and revenue growth must go hand in hand. We intend to do this in a transparent and


sincere manner, while ensuring a highest level of satisfaction to all the entities that we deal with:


customers, employees, investors, and the society around us on whom we have -- can possibly


have a positive influence. In the year 2008, we took some strides towards that vision plan.


Second question: Ebix is a rather complex company to understand. Can you sum up what Ebix


sells in a few sentences?


Ebix is an insurance services player that provides four different services in the worldwide insurance


markets: 1) B2B Exchanges; 2) Insurance Company Backend Systems; 3) Broker Systems; and


lastly, 4) BPO Insurance Services to insurance companies, brokers, large corporates, et cetera.
