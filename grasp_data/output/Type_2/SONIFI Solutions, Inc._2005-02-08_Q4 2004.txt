Good day everyone. I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time today to listen to our year-end


2004 conference call. You should have received copies of our earnings release. If not, please call


me at 605-988-1000; we'll make sure you do get a copy. Our speakers for today's call will be Scott


Petersen, President and CEO of LodgeNet; and Gary Ritondaro, our Senior Vice President and

This call is being webcast live over the Internet through our company website www.lodgenet.com.


We also have slides posted on our website which correspond with today's comments and they can


be found under the investor section.


Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that some topics could be discussed today that do not


relate to historical performance, may include or constitute forward-looking statements within the


meaning of the Federal Securities Laws and are subjected to risks, uncertainties, and other factors


that could cause actual results, performance, or achievements of the company to be materially


different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Certain of the risk


factors which could affect the company are set forth in the company’s 10-K and other filings. With


that said, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Petersen.


Scott Petersen, Chairman, President and CEO


Thank you Ann. And good afternoon everyone from a snowy day here in South Dakota. During


2004, we delivered on our joint goals of simultaneously growing our core business while at the


same time generating an increasing level of free cash flow and improved profitability metrics. We


continued our string of setting quarterly records for revenue and operating income exclusive of


depreciation and amortization having continued that run now for 45 straight quarters. We doubled


our operating income and cut our net loss by over 40%. We reduced the cost of installing the new


digital room by 10% and the cost of upgrading an existing analog room to our digital platform by


16%; both as compared to 2003. And perhaps most impressively, we generated $6.1 million of net


free cash flow during the year, calculated after deducting all expense related capital investment


activity. That's a $11 million increase over 2003 and a $33 million increase over 2002. And at the


same time, we've continued to expand our business adding 123,000 digital rooms and over 50,000


net new rooms to our base during the year, bringing our total footprint to over 1 million rooms and


our digital base to over 0.5 million rooms. I believe these results continue to reflect the strength of


our business model and the positive influence of our new digital SIGNETURE TV platform on the


company's growth prospects and financial results.


At this time I'm going to turn the call over once again to Gary Ritondaro, our Chief Financial Officer,


to give you some more color on our financial results and condition. Gary?

Gary Ritondaro, SVP Finance, Information & Administration, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon. I will be addressing my remarks today on the full year 2004


results. As you have seen from the release and as depicted on Slide number 2, we continue to


produce year-over-year increases in revenue. Total revenue for the year was $266.4 million, or a


6.5% increase over 2003. This is the result of continued growth in the number of new rooms added


to our base. We have approximately $975,000 Guest Pay rooms on our base, and as well, more of


that room base has been installed with the digital system, and these rooms tend to generate a


higher revenue per room. Our digital system is now installed in 52% of our Guest Pay room base.


The other factor having a positive effect on revenue growth for 2004 was the increase in occupancy


for those rooms we serve. The average occupancy level for 2004 increased 150 basis points over


2003.


Slide number 3 details the revenue per room per month comparison year-over-year. Movie


revenue per room per month averaged $17.40, a slight reduction of about 1% over the average


movie revenue per room per month in 2003. As we have discussed with you, less popular movies,


especially during the first half of the year versus the previous year, plus the success of the summer


Olympics, had a negative effect on movie revenue. For the quarter, however, movie revenue per


room per month was flat compared to last year. Other interactive services increased 8.5% to $5.47


per room per month. This is the result of more of our room base installed with the digital system,


higher occupancy rates, and an increase in pricing for basic cable programming.


Slide number 4 illustrates that we continued to generate more revenue per room per month as a


result of the expanded services that are made possible by the digital system. The total average


revenue per room per month for 2004 was $22.87, a 1.3% increase over last year. As you can see,


we have been experiencing a steady upward trend in our trailing 12-month revenue over the last


two years primarily because of the increasing percentage of rooms served by our digital platform.


Moving to Slide number 5, for 2004, Guest Pay gross profit on a per room per month basis was


$12.60, versus $12.49 in 2003, or a 1.5% increase. Gross margin for 2004 was 55.3%, up slightly


year-over-year. As we continue to add rooms to the base, we are maintaining our overall gross


margin. For the full year, total operating expenses per room per month was $5.06, or an increase


of 2.4%, in line with our expectations. Separating the $5.06 into our two components of operating


costs, Guest Pay operations expense per room per month was $2.97, or an increase of 1.4%. This


was due to increases in fuel costs, property taxes across our geographic footprint, and for


inflationary increases, mainly compensation and healthcare benefits. These increases were


partially offset by greater efficiencies as Guest Pay rooms increased 5.4%, while cost increased, as


I said, 1.4%.


SG&A expense per room per month was $2.09, a 4% increase over 2003. This increase was


driven by higher professional and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, and general inflationary


increases related to other operating costs, offset by a legal fee recovery which we received late in


2004. SG&A was 8.7% as a percentage of revenue.


For the year, operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization was a record $90 million.


This is an increase of 6% over 2003. As shown on the chart, the growth of operating income


exclusive of depreciation and amortization being generated by our room base has been increasing


as we add more digital rooms and occupancy levels increase. Operating income exclusive of


depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue was 33.8%, down slightly from last year.


Moving to Slide number 8, we continue to lower the cost of installing a new room digital system.


This trend continued during the fourth quarter, and for the full year 2004 we reduced the average


cost to $364 per room. This is down 10% over the cost to install a digital system in 2003, and down


14% compared to the cost of installing our tape based system back in 2000. We expect the cost to


be reduced another 10 to $15 per room during 2005. As you might have seen have seen in the
