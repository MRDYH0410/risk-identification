In the fourth quarter we finished the upgrading of our waste water treatment plant. This completes a


very busy period of construction, which included the waste water treatment plant, the new 245,000


square foot warehouse in the installation and start up of the new converting line. Also during the


quarter extensive product development efforts took place both in our paper plant and our converting


plant to give us higher tier products to offer our customers.


As discussed in our press release two days ago, the Board of Directors has initiated a quarterly


cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be reviewed by the board on a quarterly basis.


The board has reviewed our current cash position, our balance sheet leverage and the future


capital requirements of the company and is determined at the beginning a quarterly dividend


program is appropriate. This dividend reflects the Board’s confidence in the company’s long-term


cash flow and future business growth opportunities.


Now I will turn it over to Keith to discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary


Thanks, Bob. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we earned net income of $940,000 or $0.12 per share,


compared with $3.2 million or $0.40 per share for the same period of 2009. This brings our full year


result for 2010 to a net income $5.9 million or $0.76 per share, compared with $13.5 million or


$1.89 per share for the same period in 2009.


Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $22.3 million, down about $1.4 million compared to


$23.6 million in the same period of 2009. Fourth-quarter net sales were comprised of converted


product sales of $16.6 million and parent roll sales of $5.7 million. Converted product sales


decreased by 21% from those experienced in the prior quarter due to a 23% decrease in tonnage


shipped, which was partially offset by a 3% increase in net selling prices.


Weaker demand from some our major customers due to aggressive promotional pricing by major


branded producers was the primary reason for the lower shipments. Our parent roll sales increased


due to a 76% increase in tonnage shipped and a 17% increase in our net selling prices. The


increase in parent roll tonnage shipments was due to lower production requirements in our


converting operation, which result in more tons being available to sell in parent roll form and a


overall strength in the parent roll market.


For the full year of 2010, our net sales were $92.5 million, a decrease of 4% from the $96 million in


net sales in the prior year. Converted product sales in 2010 period were $74.1 million, a decrease


of 15% compared to the prior year, which was a result of a 12% decrease in product shipments and


a 3% decrease in selling prices. Net sales of parent rolls for the full year of 2010 increased


approximately 98% compared to the prior year period due to the same reason cited in the quarterly


discussion. Our tonnage increased 81%, while selling prices increased 9%.


Our gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $3.5 million or 56%


compared to the 2009 quarter. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased to 12.5% in the


current year quarter, compared to 26.8% for the same period of 2009. The year-over-year reduction


in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due to several factors.


First our cost of waste paper in the fourth quarter of 2010 was approximately 22% higher than the


cost experienced in the same period last year, which increased our cost of sales by approximately


$1 million. Secondly, lower converting product shipment volumes resulted in lower production


requirements in our converting operations, which resulted in an increase in per-unit production cost.


Also, the lower production requirements in our converting operation result in a higher percentage of


parent roll production available to sell in parent roll form. While our parent roll sales are profitable,
