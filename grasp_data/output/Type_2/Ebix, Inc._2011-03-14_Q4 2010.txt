this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer


session with instructions following at that time [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this

Neil Van Helden, Investor Relations


Welcome everyone to Ebix, Inc.’s 2010 annual earnings conference call. Joining me to discuss the


quarter is Ebix’s Chairman, President and CEO, Robin Raina. Following Robin’s remarks, we will


open up the call for your questions to be addressed by Robin and Ebix CFO, Robert Kerris.


Let me take this time to remind you that the primary purpose of today’s call is to provide you with


information regarding our full year fiscal 2010 performance. However, some of our discussions or


responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are


subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or uncertainties


materialize, or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual company results could differ


materially from these forward-looking statements.


All these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, as well as other information on potential factors that


could affect our financial results, are included in our reports filed with the SEC, including our Form


10-K for the year ended 31st of December, 2010, particularly under the heading Risk Factors.


At times in our prepared remarks or in response to your questions today, we may offer certain


additional metrics to provide a greater understanding of our business or quarterly results. Please be


advised that we may or may not update these additional metrics in the future calls.


Our press release announcing the record third quarter results for this year – the fourth quarter


results was issued a few hours back. The audio of this investor call is also being webcast live on


the web on www.ebix.com/webcast. You can look at Ebix’s financials beyond what has been


provided in the release on our website, www.ebix.com. The audio and the text transcript of this call


will be available also on the Investor homepage of the Ebix website after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.


Robin will open today’s call with a few prepared remarks and then we’ll open things up to your


questions. Because we want to address as many of you as possible, I do ask that you limit yourself


to a single question today.


With that, let me turn the call over to Robin.

you. These are record results, the best ever in our 34-year young history. At the outset, let me say


that at Ebix, we focus a lot on consistency rather than flash in the pan performances. We are


pleased with these results, as they represent another steady step forward in our growth plan. To

Cash; we started the year with $19.2 million of cash. In the year 2010, we continued to generate


strong cash flows and used that cash in a number of ways. One, we invested $15.2 million of cash


for business acquisitions. Two, we paid $22.5 million of cash to settle outstanding convertible debt.

2010.


Customers; an estimated 99.5% plus of Ebix clients from 2009 renewed their business with Ebix in


the year 2010, meaning that Ebix did not lose a single customer across the world that accounted for


more than 0.5% of Ebix revenues in the year 2010.


Diversified revenue base; Ebix continued to have a highly diversified revenue stream across


thousands of clients, with the largest client accounting for only 4% of company’s 2010 revenue.
