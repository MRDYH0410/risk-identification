MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q2 2009 Cano Petroleum, Inc.


Earnings Conference Call. My name is Becky and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time,


all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session


towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]


I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Jeff Johnson,


Chairman and CEO. Please proceed.


Jeff Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Becky. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the phone call today. Joining me in here


today is, Ben Daitch, our CFO; Patrick McKinney, our Senior Vice President of Engineering and


Operations; Mike Ricketts, our Principal Accounting Officer; and Phillip Feiner, our General


Counsel.


Well, it has been a very busy and I believe successful quarter for Cano. At the beginning of our


fiscal year, management had challenged all of our people to become more efficient and each one of


them make a difference. And I can tell you as both CEO and one of our shareholders, I’m extremely


pleased with the results to-date and I’m really excited about the path that we are on.


First and foremost, we’ve put ourselves on sound financial condition. We closed the sale of our


Pantwist assets for $42 million. We had a gain of about 21 million and owned those assets for less


than three years. We retired over $21 million of our preferred stock and by doing so decreased the


amount of outstanding preferred at about $25 million, potentially saving our shareholders almost a


10% dilution if indeed they would have converted into common upon maturity. We retired preferred


at about $0.45 on the dollar, allowing our shareholders to receive a benefit of almost $11 million.


Managing the balance sheet, we’ve reduced long-term debt by $43 million. Additionally, we entered


into two new credit facilities, totaling $145 million with a borrowing base availability of $75 million.


Operationally, although we did see a steep decline in our Barnett Shale natural gas production, I


got to tell you, we’re very pleased with the performance of our oil fields. Last quarter, we gave


guidance of flat production for this quarter. Going forward, we are going to maintain the same


guidance of flat production through the end of our fiscal year, which will be at the end of June.


As a note, we did increase our production during the second quarter and we did so without drilling


the single production well. We also announced the implementation of some cost reductions and our


shareholders are now starting to realize the benefit of it, as we are seeing some reductions in both


lease operating expenses and G&A. For the balance of the year it’s pretty simple for what we’re


going to try to achieve. Number one, we need to deploy another $3 million of capital to further


enhance overall production. Number two, continue to reduce expenses. Number three, improve


operational efficiencies company wide. And number four, maintain liquidity, manage our business


within our cash flow means.


With that, I’ll turn it over to Ben to give you a financial update.


Ben Daitch, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Jeff. For the quarter ended December 31, 2008 our net income was 13.7 million or $0.30


per share. The quarter’s net income included the following unusual items: a 10.9 million gain on the


repurchase of 22.9 million of preferred stock; an 18.9 million pre-tax unrealized gain from

derivatives due to changes in mark-to-market valuations as compared to September 30, 2008, as


commodity prices continue to erode over the quarter; 23.9 million of pre-tax impairments to our


long-lived assets and goodwill due to closing crude oil and natural gas prices on December 31,


2008. However, excluding these items, net income applicable to common stock would have been


5.2 million. Excluding after-tax income of 12.2 million from discontinued operations, we would have


incurred a net loss of $7 million.


Last year in the same period, we reported a net loss of 1.6 million or $0.04 per share. Excluding 1.8


million in unrealized loss from commodity derivatives and income from discontinued operations of


$500,000, the net loss would have been $800,000. Revenue for the quarter was 4.9 million, down


37% compared to 7.7 million for the same period last year. The quarter, oil sales volumes


increased 25% driven largely by increases at Cato, as we sold 70,000 barrels of oil versus 56,000


barrels of oil in 2007. This increase was accomplished while also building our net inventory by 2.9


thousand barrels.


For the quarter, natural gas sales volumes decreased 23% driven largely by reductions at our


Barnett Shale Properties, the 195 million cubic feet from 253 million cubic feet in 2007. Excluding


income from hedges, during the quarter, we received average prices of 52.55 barrels – per barrel of


oil and $5.70 per Mcf of gas or $47.52 per BOE versus $64.20 per BOE if you include hedge


income.


The same period last year, oil prices averaged $86.78 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged


$10.89 per Mcf or an average price of $78.37 per BOE versus $77.98 per BOE including hedging


losses. Lease operating expense on a produced BOE basis increased to $44.06 from $27.33 for


the three-month period ended December 31, 2008.


The increased was driven by increase work-over activities and increased downhole chemical


treatments at the Panhandle Properties for 1.4 million and higher operating expenses incurred at


the Cato Properties of $600,000 due to support to increase our crude oil and natural gas sales


there.


Based upon renegotiated contracts with key service providers, LOE is expected to be less over the


coming quarters. We successfully implemented a series of cost-saving actions that we referred to


during our first quarter call that reduced December LOE to $35.56 per BOE.


General and administrative expense increased by 5.8 million as compared with the same period


last year due to increased legal expense pertaining to the Panhandle fire litigation, including


settlement costs, and accruals reclaims not settled at December 31, increased legal cost


associated with regulatory compliance, $200,000 to cover the self-insured retention under our


directors and officers insurance policy associated with our stockholder lawsuit. These increases


were partially offset by $300,000 decrease in stock compensation expense. Production and ad


valorem taxes decreased $100,000 as a function of lower revenues, which is partially offset by


higher tax rates.


Depletion and depreciation expense increased from $900,000 to 1.4 million primarily due to higher


production volumes and depletion rates. As a result of year-end commodity prices on our current


outlook for our Desdemona Properties, we took a $22.4 million impairment to reclassify all proved


undeveloped locations at Desdemona to probable reserves. Additionally, we took $700,000


goodwill impairment at that entity that holds our Barnett Shale Properties due to the previously


mentioned PUD impairment.


Interest expense for the quarter was $100,000, down from $200,000 last year. Interest expense


was reduced in each quarter by 100,000 and $600,000 respectively as we capitalized interest with


respect to our projects. We incurred approximately $900,000 in preferred stock dividends for the


second quarter of both fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2008. Due to the retirement of $22.9 million
