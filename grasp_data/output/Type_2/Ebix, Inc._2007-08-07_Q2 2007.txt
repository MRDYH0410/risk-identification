MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Kanita, and I will be your conference operator today. At this


time, I would like to welcome everyone for the 2007 Second Quarter Investor Call. All lines have


been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a


question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]


I would now like to turn the conference over to Robin Raina, President and CEO of Ebix Inc. Please


go ahead, sir.


Robin Raina, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for attending Ebix 2007 second quarter investor


conference call. Our Q2 2007 financial results were announced yesterday. Let me summarize those


for you from our perspective.


Q2 results were yet again record results, the best ever in Ebix’s 32-year young history in terms of


diluted EPS. If you look at these results and compare them to the same quarter last year or to the


previous quarter in 2007 would reveal to you that the Company has shown consistent growth over


any of these periods. Incidentally, this fact becomes even more apparent if you were to compare


any of our results in previous quarters in a similar manner.


Q2 results were pleasing to us since there was nothing spectacular that accounted for these


results. No last one-time deals were booked in this quarter that accounted for this growth. It was


simply a normal organic growth with each of our divisions contributing to the increased revenue in


the quarter.


In the Ebix model of keeping a tight control on costs, increase revenue is likely to result in


increased margins as is evident in this quarter. Revenues grew consistently in Q2 of 2007 if you


were to compare it to Q1 of 2007 or Q2 of 2006. Revenues grew to 9.82 million in Q2 2007 from


9.02 million in Q1 of 2007, a 9% growth. Or if you were to compare it to Q2 of 2006, the number


was 7.03 million at that time, which means the growth was 40% as compared to Q2 of 2006.


As revenues grew, net margins in Q2 2007 grew to 26% from 22% in Q1 of 2007 and 21% in Q2 of


2006, directly revealing the basic fact that increased revenue is likely to result in increased margins


in the Ebix model of things.


Net income after taxes for the quarter rose 68% to 2.51 million or 75 cents per diluted share, up


from 1.5 million or 48 cents per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006, and earnings per share


growth of 56%. Net income after taxes for the quarter rose 28% to 2.51 million or 75 cents per


diluted share, up from 1.96 million or 61 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007, and


earnings per share growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter when you compare Q2 with Q1.


Results for the second quarter of 2007 were based on 3.37 million weighted average diluted shares


outstanding, as compared to 3.14 million in the second quarter of 2006 or 3.22 million in the first


quarter of 2007. The Company also reported basic earnings per share in the second quarter of


2007 up 85 cents as compared to 54 in the second quarter of 2006 and 69 cents in the first quarter


of 2007.


The Company also reported that cumulative net income at the end of six months of 2007 grew by


70% to 4.48 million as compared to the cumulative net income of $2.63 million at the end of six


months of 2007. The six month cumulative diluted EPS for 2007 also grew by 62% to $1.36 as


compared to cumulative diluted EPS of 84 cents at the end of six months of 2006.

In June, the Company sold 400,000 shares to less our capital. Part of the proceeds were used to


pay LaSalle bank 10 million to become a zero debt company. With improved cash flows resulting


from an increased income Ebix had 11.7 million of cash in the bank as of 30th June 2007 with an


unused credit line from LaSalle worth $14 million, the Company is presently well poised financially.


We intend to use this cash to fund our future growth in terms of acquisitions in complimentary


markets.


From a future perspective EBIX is main committed to keep striving to increase its topline and


bottomline. Our goal remains to be back-end convergence player that can follow transaction and


ensures industry across all spaces and regions across the world.


EBIX tends to let it numbers speak for itself. In our efforts to protect our competitive edge and not


provide too much data to a competition, we have normally explained from issuing constant press


releases to announce any business deals. However, if the cumulative deal file of a few deals seems


material to us with respect to Ebix present revenue, then, we would tend to let the market know


about the side of those deals.


In the same spirit of disclosure, I am pleased to convey that in the last one week Ebix INFINITY


Carrier Division have signed deals with two insurance companies, Western Insurance Company


and WRM America totaling between 6.6 million to 10.3 million. This range means there is a low end


to the range and there is a high end to the range, the low end at -- and the low end at the 6.6 million


and the high end of the deals would give us 10.3 million.


These deals involve license revenue and professional service revenue. We expect to pick this


revenue up over a period of two years as we implement these projects. We are also in discussions


with another large carrier, and we expect the deal to be closed over the next few days. And when


that happens, we will declare that to the market.


As declared earlier, Ebix has signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company in Europe


in the insurance industry. We have finished due diligence of the company and are presently


working towards the closing date, 1st of October, subject to satisfactory negotiation of the contract.


This acquisition is likely to be accretive to our results and provide us with various cross-selling


opportunities in those markets in Europe.


As always, the audio transcript of this and any of our previous calls can be heard and downloaded


from the investor homepage on the Ebix site, www.ebix.com. Also, I would encourage you to visit


the comprehensive investor homepage on the Ebix site with a view to providing a one-stop place to


analyze Ebix from an investor perspective.


With that, I am going to hand it over back to the moderator to open the call for questions. Thank


you.
