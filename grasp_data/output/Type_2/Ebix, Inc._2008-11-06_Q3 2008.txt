MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Patrick and I will be your conference operator today. At this


time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ebix 2008 Third Quarter Investor Call. All lines have


been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a


question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.


Mr. Robin Raina, you may begin your conference.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. Thank you for attending Ebix’s 2008 third quarter investor


conference call. I have also here with me Ebix’s CFO, Robert Kerris.


Our third quarter 2008 results were announced today morning. Let me summarize those results for


you from our perspective. Q3 results were yet again record results, the best ever in Ebix’s history in


terms of all three measures; diluted EPS, net income and revenues.


To compare these results to the same quarter last year or to the second quarter in 2008 would


reveal to you that the company has shown consistent growth over the last one year. Each of the


three quarters in the year 2008 has been a record result with each quarter beating all the preceding


quarters in our 32 year history as a company.


In the last 8 years, Ebix has shown a slow and steady improvement in its results with each quarter


being a bit better than the previous one. Our model health of management has been to create a


fundamentally strong company that has recurring revenue streams, good margins and good cash


flows while avoiding the high risk strategy even if at times it meant settling for lower topline growth.


From my perspective, third quarter of 2008 has been a good quarter since it reflects the


fundamental strength of the company in terms of its ability to weather storm like the recent -- sorry -


- from my perspective, Q3 2008 has been a good quarter since it reflects the fundamental strength


of the company in terms of its ability to weather storm like the recent financial crisis.


The fundamentals of our business remain strong with revenues split across hundreds of customers.


In the year 2008, no one customer is expected to account for more than 3.5% of our revenues. That


fact coupled with our position has an infrastructure player with high recurring revenue stream


insulated us to a large extent in the third quarter from the fallout of the financial crisis.


In the third quarter of 2008, Ebix reported 37% net margins, the highest ever in its history. This


margin compares well to the 31% net margin in third quarter of 2007 or 36% in second quarter of


2008. Again, while Ebix has a history of not issuing guidance, yet we have always publicly stated


our desire to keep our net margins at levels of 30% or more. So towards that extent, this has been


a satisfying quarter.


The company reported total revenue of 20.17 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to


11.81 million for the third quarter of ‘07, marking a 71% increase in revenues. The third quarter


2008 revenue of 20.17 million compares well to the 17.8 million revenue for the second quarter of


2008, marking a 13% increase.


Net income after taxes for third quarter 2008 rose 100% to 7.4 million, up from 3.69 million in the


third quarter of 2007. Net income for third quarter of 2008 rose 17% over second quarter of 2008,


net income of 6.34 million.

The company’s post split diluted EPS for third quarter of 2008 rose 88% to $0.62 as compared to


$0.33 per diluted share in third quarter of ‘07 adjusted to account for the split. The company’s post


split diluted EPS for third quarter of 2008 rose 15% to $0.62 as compared to $0.54 per diluted


share in the second quarter of 2008, adjusted to a gain to account for the split.


On October 9th, 2008, Ebix implemented a three for one split of the company’s common stock and


the proportional increase in the number of Ebix common shares. Accordingly, results for the third


quarter of 2008 were based on 12.17 million for split weighted average diluted share outstanding as


compared to 11.04 million weighted average diluted shares in the third quarter of 2007 adjusted for


split.


Just for clarity purposes, in case Ebix had not undertaken a stock split, Q3 2008 diluted EPS


number would have been presented as $1.86 -- 1.86 versus 1.62 for the second quarter of ‘08 or $1


for third quarter of ‘07.


The company’s operating expenses for the quarter grew by 49% to 12.05 million as compared to


8.09 million for the third quarter of 2007, an 11% increase or 11% increase as compared to the 10.9


million for the second quarter of ‘08. The increase in Q3 2008 expenses over Q2 2008 expenses is


primarily due to the cost associated with the acquisition of Pittsburgh based employee benefits


company Acclamation Inc in August of 2008.


Year-to-date net income through September 2008 grew by 137% to 19.4 million as compared to


8.17 million for the same period in 2007. The nine month cumulative diluted EPS for 2008 grew by


106% to $1.65 as compared to cumulative diluted EPS of $0.80 for the same period in 2007.


We are pleased with our ability to continue generating sizable cash in a recurring manner. The net


cash provided by operating activities grew by 8.63 million in the third quarter of 2008. The net cash


provided by operating activities at the end of nine month period ending 30th September, 2008 was


19.36 million as compared to the net cash number provided by operating activities of 10.66 million


at the end of the six month period ending 30th June, 2008.


We are pleased with these results as our financial results could have looked even better if the US


dollar exchange rates had remained relatively constant as compared to second quarter of 2008.


The sudden strengthening of the US dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated revenue


streams to the tune of around $400,000 in third quarter of 2008 as compared to second quarter of


2008 in Australia alone.


The recent stock split was a sign of our faith in the company’s fundamentals. It was also an attempt


to increase liquidity of the stock in the market. I am often asked lately about the recent price drop in


Ebix stock in spite of the financial turmoil having a negligible impact on the company. I have always


believed in the dynamics of the stock market and carry an inherent belief that over the long-term,


the market value of the company finally for what it is truly worth.


Towards that extent, while I care about protecting investor equity, yet as a management team we


do not obsess about the stock price or make decisions based on where the stock price is. Instead


as always, the Ebix management team remains focused on building a fundamentally strong


company with recurring revenue streams, great margins and an infrastructure business that


hopefully one day can become the largest insurance software services business in the world.


So what is next? The current turmoil in the economy, and especially the financial market is reason


to be concerned for some and reason to be cautiously opportunistic for some, whether the glass


looks half full, or half empty depends on the eyes of the beholder. I am reminded of what Warren


Buffett recently said, and I quote, “A simple rule dictates my buying, be fearful when others are


greedy and be greedy when others are fearful”.
