is Mitch and I’ll be your operator for today’s conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-


only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.


I would now like to turn the call over to Robert Jaffe, Investor Relations with Lannett. Mr. Jaffe, you


may begin.


Robert Jaffe, Investor Relations


Thanks, Mitch. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Lannett


Company’s fiscal 2010 third quarter financial results. On the call today are Arthur Bedrosian,


President and CEO, and Keith Ruck, Chief Financial Officer.


Please be advised that this conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet at


www.lannett.com. A playback of this call will be available for 3 months and may be accessed on the


Internet at Lannett’s website.


I would like to make the cautionary statement and remind everyone that all of the information


discussed on the call today is covered under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Litigation Reform


Act. The company’s discussion today will include forward-looking information, reflecting


management’s current forecast of certain aspects of the company’s future and our actual results


could differ materially from those stated or implied.


This afternoon, Arthur will review the company’s business highlights, then Keith will discuss the


financial results for the quarter in more detail followed by Arthur’s concluding remarks, we will then


open the call for questions.


With that said, let me now turn the call over to Arthur Bedrosian. Arthur?


Arthur P. Bedrosian, J.D., President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. Our top line growth in the fiscal 2010 third


quarter was primarily driven by strong sales of our pain management products, as well as certain


base business pharmaceutical products.


In December, quoted issues were resolved with the DEA, which allowed us to resume


manufacturing and shipping pain management products produced at our Cody Laboratories


subsidiary. I am pleased to announce that Cody achieved profitability in the quarter and we expect


Cody to be profitable for the foreseeable future.


While overall sales grew quarter-over-quarter, demand for our OB Natal One product decreased.


As we discussed on our last call, the manufacturer of the brand version ceased marketing and


promoting its product in December 2008, leading to a decrease in demand for our OB Natal One.


Even though we now command 95% of that market, the market size has dropped considerably. We


are exploring the possibility of selling this to a marketing firm that can resume detailing the drug or


discontinuing the drug.


We recorded strong sales of our Levothyroxine and pilocarpine products, and we were able to raise


prices of certain other products. We continue to invest in product development, which you will see


in the increased R&D expenses line. Currently, we have one new drug application and 17

abbreviated new drug applications pending at the FDA, two of which we believe are first time


generics.


We have an additional 60 product candidates in various stages of development. This is the largest


number of products we have ever had in development and compares favorably to companies much


larger than Lannett.


With that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Keith for an overview of our third quarter financial


results. Keith?


Keith R. Ruck, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Arthur, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fiscal 2010 third quarter ended March


31, 2010, net sales were $31.3 million, compared with 28.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal


2009. Gross profit was 10.4 million, compared with 11.6 million for the same period in the prior


year.


Research and development expenses increased to 3.4 million from 2.0 million in the 2009 fiscal


third quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased significantly to 4.4 million


from 7.5 million in the same quarter of the prior year, a brief explanation regarding the significant


decrease in SG&A.


In fiscal 2009, we incurred professional fees related to the patent challenge with KV


Pharmaceuticals of 2.5 million and 5.7 million for the third quarter and the 9-month periods


respectfully. Last year’s results also include 452,000 of severance costs related to a former


executive.


Operating income rose 2.7 million – rose to 2.7 million compared with 2.2 million in the fiscal 2009


third quarter. In the fiscal 2010 third quarter, the company reached a settlement with the IRS


related to its audit of our federal income tax return for fiscal 2008.


As a result of the settlement, we recorded certain additional credits and reversed certain valuation


allowances. Accordingly, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2010, was


approximately 20%. We expect our overall effective tax rate will be approximately 40 to 42% for the


full year ended June 30, 2010. Net income was 2.1 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared


with 1.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the prior-year third quarter.


Turning now to the financial results for the first nine months of fiscal 2010, net sales increased to


91.4 million from 83.6 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2009. Gross profit was 30 million


compared with 31.6 million for the same period in the prior year. R&D expenses increased to 9.1


million from 5.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses decreased to 12.2


million from 19.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Net income grew to 5 million or $0.20


per diluted share, from 4.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the first 9 months of the prior year.


Turning to the balance sheet, the company has approximately 19.5 million in cash, cash


equivalents and short-term investment securities available for sale and approximately $8 million of


long-term debt, including the current portion.


With that brief financial overview, I’ll now turn the call back over to Arthur. Arthur?
