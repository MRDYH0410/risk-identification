MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, and thank you for participating in today’s conference call to discuss KIT


digital’s Fourth Quarter and Year End 2008 Financial Results for the period ending December 31,


2008.


With us today are Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KIT digital; Gavin


Campion, the company’s President; and Robin Smyth, the company’s Chief Financial Officer.


Following their remarks, we will open up the call for questions.


Before I continue, I would like to take a moment to read the company’s Safe Harbor statement.


Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include risks and uncertainties, such as


the inability to finance the company’s operations or expansion, inability to hire and retain qualified


personnel, changes in the general economic climate, including risks, rising interest rates and


unanticipated events, such as terrorism activities.


Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements


are reasonable, such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the company or


any other person, that such forward-looking statements will be achieved. The company undertakes


no duty to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future


events or otherwise. For further risk factors, see the risk factors associated with the company’s


review in today’s SEC filings.


I would like to remind everyone that this call will be available for replay through May 8, 2009,


starting this afternoon at 1:30 PM eastern time. A webcast replay will also be available via the link


provided in today’s press release.


Now, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KIT digital, Mr.


Kaleil Isaza Tuzman. Please proceed.


Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Lindy. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those of you calling in from


Eastern parts of the world. It’s all relative, but we’re currently sitting here in New York on what


seems like a snowy or a rainy day, hard to tell.


Thank you for joining us today to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the year ended


December 31, 2008. Yesterday in the evening, as promised, we issued a press release announcing


our financial results for the fourth quarter and our full year 2008 results and we’ll be filing our 10-K


shortly. This morning, we also put out a press release short time ago with respect to our acquisition


of the Narrowstep assets, which we’ll address near the end of this call.


The earnings release revealed that the fourth quarter and full year 2008 represented great progress


across the board. Despite the challenging global economic conditions of 2008, we surpassed the


promises we made as new management on January 9, 2008, the beginning of that year when we


came in, to exceed 20 million in revenue during the period of 2008 and we promised that we would


turn the corner to operating cash flow positive by December – by the month of December 2008.


In fact, we ended the year by exceeding our revenue goal by more than three million. We reported


23.4 million top line and we achieved positive operating cash flow for the entirety of the fourth


quarter.


During 2008, I know, some of you on the call may not be aware have come in more recently as a


shareholder, but we simplified our capital structure by eliminating the outstanding preferred

securities, sometimes known as blank check preferred securities. They existed in the beginning of


2008 when we came on and we’re somewhat toxic to common investors – those are long gone. We


now put in place a charter provision that effectively makes it impossible or extremely difficult to


have any preferred securities issued in the future.


We’ve also strengthened our management team and our Board of Directors during the course of


2008 and the beginning of this year.


Before I comment further, I’d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Robin Smyth, to review some of


the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 in more detail. Afterwards our


President, Gavin Campion, will discuss our Q4 operational highlights and the current state of our


business.


We will then discuss some of the important events and achievements for the quarter and our


outlook for 2009, as well as I mentioned a short discussion with respect to the Narrowstep asset


acquisition.


I wanted to add, because Lindy didn’t mention that Jonathan Hirst, our incoming CFO is also here


with us and we’ll introduce him to those on the call. And then finally, we’ll be open of course to your


questions. Robin, I’ll hand it to you.


Robin Smyth, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Kaleil. We’ve ended the year with a very positive result financially. Revenue in Q4


totaled nine million, an increase of 68% from 5.4 million in the previous quarter and 131% increase


from 3.9 million in the same quarter a year ago.


Revenue for the full year of 2008 totaled 23.4 million, as Kaleil has said, an increase of 68% from


our 2007 number of 13.9 million. The company’s revenues are primarily comprised of software


license and maintenance fees, software set-up fees, and technical and creative service charges.


The year-over-year revenue improvement is principally due of course to the increase in our


customers, increase in spending by existing customers, as we had a lot of larger customers come


into the – our revenue mix, and also the inclusion of revenue from acquisitions made in 2008.


The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 2.5 million or $0.75 per weighted average share


outstanding. This compares to a loss of 12.5 million or $11.21 per weighted average share


outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2007.


The net loss of 2008 was 19 million or $7.55 per weighted average share outstanding, was an


improvement of the net loss of 34.6 million or $34.69 per weighted average share outstanding in


2007. The net losses include for the year included the non-cash stock-based compensation of 4.9


million in 2008 and the 4.7 million in 2007. We had restructuring charges during year two of 3.1


million related to employee termination and acquisition-related facility closing costs during 2008.


We are also pleased to announce that the Q4 operating EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP term, which


is detailed in the press release, was a positive $32,000 or $0.01 per weighted average share


outstanding, as compared to 1.6 million loss, or $0.48 per weighted average share outstanding in


the previous quarter, and a loss of 5.2 million or $4.69 per weighted average share for the fourth


quarter in 2007.


In 2008, operating EBITDA totaled a loss of 7.2 million or $2.88 per weighted average share


outstanding, as compared to a loss of 22.6 million or $22.68 per weighted average share


outstanding in 2007.
