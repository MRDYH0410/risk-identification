That positive overall performance for 2008 is almost irrelevant now, however, given the rapid


change in the market for our services and our relatively negative outlook for 2009.


Rather than review our financial results which we’ve laid out in detail in our press release, Alan will


comment on some of the specifics for the quarter and then I’ll come back on to review what we’re


seeing today in each of our business segments and then get directed to your questions. Alan?


Alan Krenek, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary


Thanks, Ken and good morning to everyone. I’ll give you a brief overview of the fourth quarter and


then discuss our balance sheet, liquidity and capital requirements. Revenue for the fourth quarter of


2008 was 246 million, an increase of 9% from the same period in 2007. Adjusted EBITDA was 61.5


million or 25% of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to EBITDA of 64.4 million or 29% of


revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007.


We had several one-time items in the fourth quarter of 2008. First, we recorded 12.2 million of after-


tax income related to the Grey Wolf break-up fee we received in December. Second, we recorded a


22.5 million non-tax deductible goodwill charge, which I will discuss in more detail later.


Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding the one-time items, I just discussed, was 14.2


million or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to 19.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth


quarter of 2007. Net income as reported for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 3.9 million or $0.10 per


diluted share, which included the one-time items.


Our G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 32.1 million, or 13% of revenue, compared to


25.3 million or 11% of revenue during the fourth quarter 2007. Sequentially, G&A was up by 1.6


million, mainly due to approximately 900,000 of uninsured losses as well as a full quarter effect of


the G&A from the acquisition of the Azurite companies that closed in late September 2008.


We expect to see a reduction in G&A expense in 2009 as we adapt our administrative infrastructure


to lower business activity levels. We currently project that G&A expense for 2009 will be slightly


lower than the amount for 2008, despite the full year effect of the G&A from the Azurite acquisition.


Depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter 2008 was 32.6 million, compared to


26.2 million in the same period of 2007. This increase reflects the capital expenditure program we


completed in 2008 as well as the five acquisitions that we closed in 2008. Depreciation expense in


2009 will increase as we see the full year effect of the Azurite acquisition as well as the additional


depreciation from our 2009 capital expenditure program.


Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 was 6.3 million, down from 6.7 million in the


fourth quarter 2007. It was up from 5.7 million in the third quarter of 2008 due to the higher LIBOR


rates on our outstanding revolver balance in the fourth quarter and the additional interest on the


$30 million drawdown on our revolver in late September for the Azurite acquisition.


In the first quarter 2009, we’ve been able to accept the interest rates on our revolver at much lower


levels and expect to see a sizeable reduction in interest expense in the near term. As outlined in


our press release, we recognized a 22.5 million non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge in


the fourth quarter 2008. We are required at least once a year to determine if the recorded value of


the goodwill we are carrying on our books reflects its fair value.


At December 31, it was determined that the carrying value of our Contract Drilling segment


exceeded its fair value. Based on this, we have to write-off the entire goodwill amount that was


recorded in 2007 in connection with the Sledge Drilling Inc. acquisition. No other assets were


impaired as of December 31.
