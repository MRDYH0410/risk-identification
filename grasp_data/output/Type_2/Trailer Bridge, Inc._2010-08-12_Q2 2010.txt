MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Trailer Bridge 2010 Second Quarter


Conference Call. At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and


that all participants are currently in a listen-only mode.


I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Ivy Suter, CEO.


Ivy Barton Suter, Chief Executive Officer


Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Today’s remarks are


presses with the usual Safe Harbor language. This call will contain forward-looking statements


within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking


statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve the usual risks and uncertainties.


Among those risks are those listed in our press release of yesterday.


With us on the call today are Trailer Bridge’s Chief Financial Officer, Mark Tanner; and our


Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Bill Gotimer. I’m pleased to report that our second


quarter financial results showed continued improvement in operating income and EBITDA both over


prior year and sequentially with net income at $0.07 per diluted share. Our total revenue increased


13.5% over prior year on higher volume.


As I have stated previously, asset utilization is our top priority and we have achieved 100%


southbound utilization in this quarter based on a consistent historical method for this calculation. I


want to emphasize that we have upside on southbound utilization in the range of 18%. Mark Tanner


will provide more details later in the call to address this additional capacity. We have seen yields


stabilize in the Puerto Rico market on our core container southbound business this past quarter and


have multiple initiatives in place for yield improvement.


Although fuel prices were higher than prior year, we have improved our effectiveness in managing


fuel surcharges versus the first quarter of 2010. From a headwind perspective, charter hire revenue


is lower than prior year in large part due to a drop in oilfield activity. We are addressing this


segment of our business by adding more resources in marketing and sales to expand into other


market segments and improve charter hire asset utilization.


We continue to see positive results from our operational excellence initiative and our operating ratio


has improved from 92% to 89% sequentially. Cash generation remains strong and we are well


underway with our ro/ro ramp construction in San Juan, which is our major CapEx for 2010.


I’ll now turn this over to Mark Tanner, who will take us through the financials. Mark?


Mark A. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President – Administration


Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. I’d like to begin with a brief overview of the results


for the quarter, and then I will go into a little more detail. This quarter was the sixth consecutive


quarter of improved quarter-over-quarter bottom-line performance and it was driven by strong top-


line growth and diligent cost control initiatives. Compared to the prior-year quarter, revenue is 31.7


million, up 3.8 million or 13%,operating income is 3.4 million, up 6%; EBITDA is 4.9 million, up 4%;


net income is 897,000, up 37%; and diluted earnings per share is $0.07 versus the $0.05 reported


for the prior period.


More importantly, the results improved significantly sequentially with revenue up 2.8 million or 10%,


operating income up 1.2 million or 52%, EBITDA up 1.2 million or 31% and net income up 1.2

million. The strong revenue growth was driven by record high utilization southbound reaching the


100% level per quarter for the first time. Overall volume increased by 13% with the southbound


lane increasing by 20% being partially offset by a 10% decline in the northbound lane. The biggest


volume gain of southbound were the container volume to the Dominican Republic, up 117%


followed closely by new vehicles to Puerto Rico, up 108% and the Puerto Rico container volume


was up 4%.


The weakness in northbound volume was driven primarily by a 16% decrease in container volume


for the Puerto Rico lane that was partially offset by a 31% increase in container volume from the


Dominican Republic. The strong volume performance southbound combined with the 42% increase


in the average fuel surcharge rate resulted in 4.7 million of fuel surcharge revenue, up 1.5 million or


48%. On the negative side, charter hire revenue was off last year’s record pace by 904,000 or 51%


on weak demand for TBC vessel charters. We currently have one TBC vessel on charter and two


vessels available for charter.


Management has focused on additional resources during the third quarter to expand the search for


new charter hire opportunities going forward. Overall yield on an equivalent unit basis is flat


compared to the prior year, but it did show some signs of recovery sequentially, up 1.5%. The


sequential improvement is directly related to the increase in volume of the higher rated Dominican


Republic service volume in the mix both in the southbound and northbound lanes.


Puerto Rico rates were still down compared to the prior year period driven by the lower vehicle rate


southbound. Sequentially, Puerto Rico rates are flat. Operating income for the quarter is 3.4 million,


an improvement of 183,000 or 6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by the strong


revenue performance, no dry-docking expense and 250,000 less in legal fees related to the


Department of Justice investigation. Other than the expected expense increases in movement


volume, fuel expense was up by 1 million on higher average fuel prices and maintenance expense


on equipment was also up by 500,000.


Sequentially, operating income improved by 1.2 million, or 52% on the stronger volume


performance and a 1.5% improvement in overall yield. In addition to the expected variable expense


increase, fuel was up 113,000 on increased fuel prices, and equipment maintenance expense was


also up to 460,000.


The net fuel cost for the second quarter, which is our measure of the actual fuel expense


represented on the income statement plus an estimate of fuel cost embedded in our outside


transportation expense less our actual fuel surcharge revenue, is 1.2 million, a 21% improvement


sequentially, but 160,000 or 60% off the prior-year period. The sequential improvement was driven


by the increase in volume combined with a 10% increase in average fuel surcharges per load.


We implemented two additional fuel surcharges since the first quarter, one that was filed in June


and the other was filed in August and will take effect in early September.


The operating ratio for the second quarter is 89%, essentially flat from last year with a 3-point


improvement sequentially from the 92% level. The net income for the quarter is 897,000, a 241,000


or 37% improvement over the prior-year period, and a $1.2 million improvement sequentially. The


diluted net income per share for the second quarter is $0.07, up $0.02 per share over the prior year


and up $0.10 per share sequentially.


For the quarter, EBITDA is 4.9 million, a 31% improvement sequentially and up 4% over the prior-


year period. EBITDA is derived by adding the $2.5 million of interest expense and the $1.6 million


of depreciation to the net income of 897,000. Adjusting for 146,000 of legal expenses related to the


antitrust investigation and 226,000 in non-cash option amortization expense including the salary


line, our adjusted EBITDA is 5.3 million.
