MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ebix, Inc. 2009 Annual Results


Investor Call. [Operator Instructions]


I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Robin Raina, President and CEO


of Ebix, Inc. Please go ahead.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning, everybody. Thank you for attending Ebix 2009 Annual Investor Call. I have also with


me today Mr. Robert Kerris, Ebix’s Chief Financial Officer on this investor conference call.


We announced our 2009 financial results earlier today and all of you must have seen those


numbers by now. I’ll take a few minutes to summarize these results for you.


Each of the last nine years had been a record year for Ebix in terms of beating all its results in the


last 34 years. This year was no different from the last year to the extent that the financial results for


the year 2009 are record results again, the best ever in our 34 year young history.


To get a better understanding of the results announced today, I will also outline a few metrics from


the past three years for you. I will also present and analyze run rate based on the Q4 2009 results.


This annualized run rate is not guidance on future results but is simply meant to convey a


conservative annual run rate based on Q4, 2009 results.


Annualized revenue run rate; first topic. Based on Q4 2009 results, Ebix’s annualized revenue run


rate for 2010 would be 125.2 million even if Ebix showed zero revenue growth in 2010. Ebix’s 2009


fourth quarter revenue rose 55% to 31.3 million as compared to 20.1 million in Q4 of 2008, 157%


as compared to Q4 of 2007 and 237% as compared to fourth quarter of 2006. Ebix’s total revenue


for the full year of 2009 rose 31% to 97.7 million, compared to 74.8 million in 2008, 128% as


compared to 2007 and 234% as compared to 2006.


Second topic, annualized net income run rate. Based on Q4 2009 results, Ebix’s annualized net


income run rate for 2010 would be approximately 48 million. Ebix’s 2009 fourth quarter net income


rose 53% to 12.1 million as compared to 7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, 169% as


compared to fourth quarter of 2007 and 625% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Ebix’s net


income for the full year of 2009 grew 42% to 38.8 million year-over-year, 207% as compared to


2007 and 551% as compared to 2006.


Third topic, diluted EPS. Ebix’s 2009 fourth quarter pre-split diluted EPS rose 40% to $0.92 as


compared to $0.66 in the fourth quarter of 2008, 130% as compared to $0.40 in the fourth quarter


of 2007 and 411% as compared to $0.18 during the fourth quarter of 2006.


Results for the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter 2008 were based on 13.2 and 12.2


million weighted average diluted shares outstanding respectively. All these results are pre-split


since the three-for-one split was made effective on 4 January, 2010.


Ebix’s diluted EPS for the full year of 2009 grew 36% year-over-year to $3.10, 158% as compared


to 2007 and 392% as compared to 2006. For purposes of EPS calculation, there was an average of


approximately 12.7 million diluted shares outstanding during the year 2009 as compared to an


average of 12.3 million pre-split diluted shares outstanding in 2008.


Next topic, net margins. Our net margins continued to improve increasing to 40% for the full year of


2009 from 37% in 2008, 30% in 2007 and 20% in 2006. Net margins in fourth quarter of 2009 were

41% before taking into account non-recurring charges associated with the acquisitions and 39%


after taking into account the non-recurring charges associated with the two acquisitions in the fourth


quarter of 2009. This compares with 39% in fourth quarter of 2008, 37% in fourth quarter of 2007


and 18% during the fourth quarter of 2006.


Next topic, operating cash flows. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2009, the company


generated $33.9 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to 26.8 million for the


year ended December 31, 2008, a 26% increase in operating cash flows year-over-year.


Cash generated from operations for the fiscal fourth quarter was 11.8 million, up 59% year-over-


year. This implies annualized cash flow of 47.2 million, even if Ebix was to operate at the same


level of operating cash flows throughout 2010.


Next metric, customers. An estimated 99.5% plus of Ebix clients from 2008 renewed their business


with Ebix in the year 2009, meaning that Ebix did not lose a single customer across the world that


accounted for more than 0.5% of Ebix revenues in the year 2008 or 2009.


Next metric, channel revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Exchange channel grew 78%


year-over-year, to $21.4 million or 68% of fourth quarter of 2009 revenues. The BPO channel grew


33% year-over-year, to four million or 13% of the fourth quarter 2009 revenues. The Broker channel


grew 87% year-over-year, to 3.4 million or 11% of fourth quarter 2009 revenues. The Carrier


channel dropped 23% year-over-year, to $2.5 million or 8% of the fourth quarter 2009 revenues.


We believe that the drop in revenues from the sale of back-end systems to insurance carriers was


directly related to a freeze in spending related to back-end system in insurance companies. We


expect things to improve and the Carrier channel to start growing again.


Next metric, R&D headquarters. As a part of our efforts to grow across the world, the company has


centralized its international intellectual property and development operations in Singapore and India


with over 60% of its R&D staff based in these two countries. Ebix is entitled to a subsidized tax rate


of 10% in Singapore and a zero percent tax rate till the year 2015 in India.


Next topic, tax forecast for 2010 and beyond. The company expects its blended worldwide income


tax rate to be in the range of 6 to 8% for the fiscal year 2010 and a gradual increase to a blended


worldwide tax rate of 8 to 12% over the following few years.


Next topic, long-term debt. As of 31st December 2009, the company had used 23.1 million from a


revolving line of credit with Bank of America. Subsequently in February 2010, we replaced this line


with a new 10 million term loan over two years and a 20 million – and a 25 million revolving line of


credit both at LIBOR plus 1.75 presently implying 1.92% interest. The line also has an accordion


feature for another 10 million debt. At present we’re still only using 23.1 million from this 45 million


borrowing capacity.


Next topic, convertible debt. As of 31st December 2009, the convertible debt balance stood at 28.6


million. Since then Whitebox Advisors has exercised part of this convertible debt. This means that


the total convertible debt as on date is approximately 25 million. This convertible debt is at a zero


rate of interest and will have the effect of not diluting any shareholders since the company intends


to pay for these converted cash. This 25 million convertible debt today is incurring a non-cash


expense of 1.75% in our financials as if the interest was being paid in line with FAS 14-1 guideline.


Next topic, accounts receivable. The company’s operating cash flow of 11.8 million in the fourth


quarter of 2009 speaks for itself. The company’s almost perfect customer retention rate has been


driven by an excellent relation with our customers and it also reflects in the company not having


any material collection issues over the last decade.
