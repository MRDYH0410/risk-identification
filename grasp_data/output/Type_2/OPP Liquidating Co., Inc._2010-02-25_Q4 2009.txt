MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Operator. Welcome to Orchids Paper Products Company’s Fourth Quarter Earnings


Conference Call. My name is Keith Schroeder and I’m the Chief Financial Officer of the company. I


am pleased to be here today with Bob Snyder, our President and Chief Executive Officer.


This morning we will be discussing our financial results for the quarter, which we released


yesterday afternoon. The agenda for today’s call will be as follows. First, Bob will discuss our


performance in the quarter and for the year, and discuss various initiatives we worked on within the


company. I will then provide a discussion of the results and some key financial metrics. Following


that discussion, I will turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks. After Bob’s remarks,


we’ll be happy to address any questions that you might have.


And with that, I would like to inform you that statements made during this conference call other than


those that refer to past events and results are forward-looking statements and are made pursuant


to the Safe Harbor provisions in the Securities Reform Act of 1995.


Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially


from those set forth during this discussion. Among other things, these risks and uncertainties


include the risk and assumptions ascribed in item 1A and item 7 of our Form 10-K for the year


ended December 31, 2008 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended


September 30, 2009. We operate in an environment that involves numerous known and unknown


risk and uncertainties that could materially affect our operations. We assume no obligation to


update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of any subsequent


events.


With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Snyder.


Robert A. Snyder, President and Chief Executive Officer


Welcome fellow shareholders. Thanks, Keith. I am Bob Snyder, President and Chief Executive


Officer of Orchids Paper Products. It’s great to speak with you again.


In the fourth quarter of 2009, we achieved net sales of over 23.6 million, down 3% from last year’s


fourth quarter and earnings of $0.40 per diluted share, a $0.06 increase over the fourth quarter of


2008, a 17.6% improvement. For the year 2009, we achieved record net sales of 96 million, up 6%


from the 2008 results, and earnings per share increased 139% to $1.89 per diluted share.


During the fourth quarter of 2009, the major areas of interest were; in the papermaking plant, we


had papermaking production in the fourth quarter of 2009 of 13,890 tons. During 2009, we


produced 52,920 tons, a 5.3% decrease over 2008. Curtailing operations to adjust for parent roll


sales is the major reason for the decrease. With continued improvement in the parent roll market,


we now have all paper machines in full operation.


In the converting plant, we produced over 1.7 million cases in the fourth quarter, a 5.7% increase


over the same quarter of last year. During 2009, we produced a record 7.2 million cases, a 14%


improvement over 2008. We had shipments in the fourth quarter equivalent to the fourth quarter of


2008 shipments. Overall, in 2009, shipments improved 9% over 2008.


Construction on a new 245,000 square foot warehouse is going well. It is over halfway towards


completion and is on-track for installation of the new converting line by mid-2010. As previously


stated, the new warehouse will enable us to consolidate our converted product inventory and

shipping in one location, eliminate third-party storage and shipping cost, and optimize our customer


service and logistics performance. Furthermore, it will free up the necessary physical space in our


existing converting facility with a new converting line.


The new converting line has been checked out at the vendor’s plant and is on schedule for delivery


and start-up to fit in with our construction time table. It is quite an impressive piece of equipment.


The state-of-the-art line with the capability to produce up to 4 million cases per year will produce


both bathroom tissue and towel products as well enable us to provide a broader range of products,


better product configurations, enhanced graphics and improved embossing.


The warehouse and new converting line projects are in line with our strategy to increase sales and


profitability and to consume all of our papermaking production in the converting operation.


We are encouraged by the continued positive impact and sustained improvements as a result of the


coordinated efforts of our management team and the Orchids workforce in 2009 and look forward to


our future.


Now, I will turn it over to Keith to discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Bob. For the fourth quarter 2009, we reported net income of $3.2 million or $0.40 per


diluted share compared with net income of 2.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same period


of 2008.


The fourth quarter result brings our year-to-date net income to 13.6 million, which is a new record


or $1.89 per diluted share compared with 5.2 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the same period


of 2008.


The earnings per share calculations for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2009 reflect the


effects of our successful follow-on offering of 862,500 shares in the third quarter of 2009. Our net


sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 were 23.6 million, a decrease of 3% over the 24.3 million net


sales we reported for the same period last year. The year-over-over decrease was primarily due to


the lower parent roll sales.


Net sales of converted products in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased slightly to 20.9 million


compared to 21.1 million in the prior year quarter, which was primarily the result of a 2.5%


decrease in net selling prices being mostly offset by a 1% increase in the tonnage shipped.


Increased promotional activity in 2009 quarter was the primary reason for the lower selling prices.


Net sales of parent rolls in the current year quarter decreased $430,000 or 14% to 2.7 million


compared to 3.2 million in the same period of 2008. Parent roll sales decreased due to a 27%


decrease in net selling price, which was partially offset by an 18% increase in the amount of


tonnage shipped. While the parent roll market is still fairly soft, we have seen some signs of


strengthening, as a sequential quarter comparison of the third and fourth quarters in 2009 shows a


12% increase in the tonnage shipped with prices remaining relatively flat.


Compared to the third quarter of 2009, our net sales of converted product decreased approximately


6% on approximately 3% lower per ton selling prices, which was mostly due to the increased


promotional pricing and 2% lower shipments.


For the full year of 2009, net sales increased 6% to 96 million compared to 90.2 million in the same


period in 2008. Our converted net product sales increased by 16% or 11.7 million in the 2009 year
