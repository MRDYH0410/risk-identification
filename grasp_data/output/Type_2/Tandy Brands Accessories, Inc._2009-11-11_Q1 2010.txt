MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Tandy First Quarter 2010 Conference Call and webcast.


At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and a brief question-and-answer session will


follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being


recorded.


It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Craig Mackey, Chief Financial Officer for Tandy.


Thank you, Mr. Mackey. You may now begin.


M.C. Mackey, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive Vice President


Thank you. I’d like to read the Safe Harbor statement. Except for historical information contained


herein, the statements on this call are forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor


provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements


involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause the company’s actual results


in the future periods to differ materially from forecasted or expected results. Those risks include,


among other things, the competitive environment in the industry, in general and in the company’s


specific market areas, changes in cost of the goods and services and economic conditions in


general and in the company’s specific market areas. Those and other risks are more fully


described in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Before we begin, our prepared comments I’d like to inform everyone that in conjunction with today’s


earnings announcement, we have changed how we report our results. As a result of restructuring


our organization in the latter part of fiscal 2009, we changed our reportable business segments to


focus on product categories.


Our product categories, our accessories and gifts. This represents a change from our previously


reported men’s and women’s, our form 10-Q has reclassified historical information to fiscal 2009. It


is important to note that these reclassifications have no impact on Tandy’s previously reported


financial statements.


I would now like to introduce Rod McGeachy, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman


of the Board.


N. Roderick McGeachy III, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President


Thanks Craig and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your


interest in our company. On the call today, I’ll have some brief introductory comments and then


Craig will go into more detail regarding the financial results. After that, I’ll review some of the key


developments of the quarter and then update our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2010. Then we


will open the call to your questions.


For the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended September 30, 2009, Tandy reported net income of $1.1


million, or $0.15 per diluted share, on net sales of $32.7 million (sic) [$37.2 million]. In the first

The company reported operating income of $69,000 in the quarter a $1.1 million positive swing


over last year’s results. I think it’s important to note that included in our operating income are


transaction expenses of $289,000. It’s important to note that our operating income was $358,000 a


$1.3 million positive swing over last year before taking this into account. The results of the first


quarter show that your company is making significant progress in growing sales and improving


profitability. The year-over-year quarterly sales increase was the first one reported by Tandy in the


past 12 quarters and we fully expect that trend to continue throughout the year. Obviously the


weak economic environment and specifically the protracted soft retail climate continues to impact


financial results and our retail partners continue to take a conservative approach to their inventory


replenishment as they head into the holiday season.


With that said, however we are pleased that we been able to deliver growth in this environment and


we believe we are well positioned with our retail partners to gain share and have a successful


holiday season.


I’ll now turn it back over to Craig, who’ll provide a more detailed review of our financial results.


M.C. Mackey, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive Vice President


Thank you, Rod. To reiterate the company’s financial results for the first quarter fiscal 2010, the


company reported net sales of $37.2 million and net income of $1.1 million or $0.15 per diluted


share. For the first quarter of 2009, the company reported net sales of $34.6 million and a net loss


of [audio gap] $1.3 million or $0.18 per share. A couple of quick points on some of the key items on


the income statements, net sales increased 8% in the quarter as a result of solid contributions from


all product categories paced by the growth in the gift business and incremental sales generated by


the Chambers Belt acquisition. Gift sales in the quarter were $5.4 million versus $3.4 million a year


ago, a 59% increase. Chambers related sales generated $6.1 million in sales in the quarter. Our


gross margin for the current quarter – for the current year first quarter was 38.3% compared to


34.7% in the first quarter of last year. The improvement in gross margin was due to several factors


including increased margins in the gift business, improved assortments, improved inventory


management and better product sourcing.


SG&A expenses for the most recent quarter were $13.2 million versus $12.4 million for the same


quarter last year and declined as a percentage of sales going from 35.9% of revenues to 35.5%.


We expect to see continued improvement in this area throughout fiscal 2010. The company’s


operating income was $69,000 in the quarter, an improvement of more than $1.1 million over the


prior year results.


Moving on to review some of the key parts of the balance sheet, we had cash of $1.9 million as of


September 30 and accounts receivable were $26.9 million. Inventory levels were $36.1 million at


September 30. This compares with inventories of nearly $48.5 million at September 30, 2008. So,


you can see the progress that we have made improving inventory turns in making our inventories


more productive.


Total current assets were $72.1 million, total current liabilities were $38.7 million giving us working


capital of $33.4 million. Total assets were $85 million, total shareholder equity as of September 30,


2009 was $43.3 million, which equates to a book value of $6.09 per share. Regarding debt, we


ended the first quarter with outstanding borrowings of $16.5 million. This debt level was due to


seasonal borrowing requirements.


I’ll now turn the call back over to Rod.
