QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION


Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
Here we go again.


Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Julie Kutow, Simmons & Company.


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
Hello?


<Q>:
 
Can you hear me?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
We can now Julie, yes.


<Q>:
 
Okay, good. How are you guys doing?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
We’re doing well, thank you.


<Q>:
 
Good, thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your committed position


for the year? I know that last quarter you were standing at about two-thirds either delivered or


committed for 2009?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
Yeah, Julie, this is Dan Cohrs. We worked our way through the bulk of those


pre-sales as went through the bulk of the deliveries through April, so there’s still a few contracts left


under pre-sales. But for the rest of the year we’re looking more at spot sales and new pre-sales for


the fall.


<Q>:
 
Okay. And that kind of leads into my other question. I was looking through your 10-Q at your


accounts receivable where you have it broken out. And I know we saw a big drop in your overall


accounts receivable, but specifically looking at your pre-sale contract receivables, is that purely a


function of your seasonal business or were they down more this quarter than in previous years?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
It’s really truly a function of the seasonal business. We collected large amounts


of cash during the quarter on those pre-sale contracts. And so, actually the cash came in on the


required payment dates, but then in some cases the deliveries actually didn’t take place until later,


in some cases not until April. So the receivable goes away when we receive that cash.


<Q>:
 
Okay. And then looking for Q3, when would you expect that pre-sale receivable account to


start ticking back up?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
We’re starting to see some activity in that market.


<Q>:
 
Okay.


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
But we should see some gradual increases in receivables as we sign those


contracts.


<Q>:
 
Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.


<A – D. Hunt Ramsbottom>:
 
Thank you.


Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Burns, Johnson Rice.

<Q – William Burns>:
 
When I was looking at the Q yesterday evening late, the first thing that


came to my mind was, I wonder what they’re going to do about their EBITDA guidance at the


fertilizer plant.


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
Now you know.


<Q – William Burns>:
 
It was a great surprise to come in and you all raised the guidance. And it’s


because I didn’t see the April sales. And I believe you started to hit on it and I just couldn’t keep up


on the conference call, but when I look at in the 10-Q under tonnage first quarter and second


quarter, it’s about 180,000 tons, and if you compare that to the first and second quarter in 2008, it


was 274,000 tons. I mean it’s a quite a drop off. And then in the second half of ‘08, it looks like you


were able to do 369,000 tons. So when you look at April, I mean, just could you go over like your


thoughts of how you can raise your guidance just looking at April?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
Well, we know what we had pre-sold for the year, right. So the point about the


second quarter is it’s purely a matter of when the shipments and deliveries took place, which is


determined by weather.


<Q – William Burns>:
 
Right.


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
We had the product pre-sold going into the quarter, but bad weather prevented


us from delivering. The revenue comes through as we delivered the product. So what you see


through the second quarter are – as you just said – some unfavorable comparisons to the prior


year, but April was so big that, first of all, we knew those deliveries would take place. It was just a


matter of when they would take place, because they were already under contract. And so April was


so strong that we now feel much more confident in the rest of the year having those deliveries take


place. So we’re just confident that EBITDA is going to be higher than 50 million.


<Q – William Burns>:
 
Well that’s actually what I was looking for is confidence on your side as you


see the second half unfolding. And then maybe just on accounting, a lot of the other companies I


follow have these convertible bonds, you have one too. When do we have to start looking at that


APB 14-1 for convertibles? You have to do that in your first fiscal quarter?


<A – D. Hunt Ramsbottom>:
 
Are those the 2013 bonds?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
These bonds are due in 2013. I’m not quite sure exactly which issue you’re


asking me about?


<Q – William Burns>:
 
There’s – the accounting financial standard practices, what is it, 14-1, where


you have to book as interest what the interest would have been had it been straight up without the


convertible, and so you end up with the cash interest and also some non-cash interest in your P&L?


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
That one, I’ll have to check on. I mean --


<Q – William Burns>:
 
No, okay. Well that one I can call you back on.


<A – Dan Cohrs>:
 
Yeah.


<Q – William Burns>:
 
And then maybe for Hunt, I’m just looking for a size on the plant that you’re


talking about. I know you’ve talked about this like almost a year ago. You talked about focusing on


these smaller type plants. And I’m trying to get a handle on what the CapEx would be on something


like that?


<A – D. Hunt Ramsbottom>:
 
Yeah.
