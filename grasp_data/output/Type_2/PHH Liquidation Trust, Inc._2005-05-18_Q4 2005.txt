MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to this Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. Conference Call. Today’s call is


being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over


to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Larry Keener. Please go ahead, sir.


Larry H. Keener, President and Chief Executive Office


Thank you Dustin, and welcome everyone to our Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference Call. I


have with me today, Kelly Tacke, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Applin, President of


CountryPlace Mortgage; and Lyle Zeller, Executive Vice President of CountryPlace Mortgage.


Before I begin our discussion, our lawyers compel me to remind you that all comments made herein


are made against the backdrop of the Safe Harbor rules and, of course, past performance is no


guarantee of future results and our predictions of a rosy future may not materialize.


Every quarter, we try to open our conference calls with an anecdote or success story that will help


communicate the unique nature of our company, our products and our people.


This quarter I would like to tell you about two projects we are partnering with an innovative builder


developer in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. Each project has had its successful grand opening within


the past 10 days. The first is DeWitt Landings of Greenhills, Ohio. DeWitt Landings is a 92-lot


redevelopment of the 1930s era PUD by Potterhill homes using our Discovery custom homes


product. We have finished four of the seven original models ranging in square footage from 1500


square feet to 2500 square feet and price from a $170,000 to $350,000. These homes are one and


two story thoroughly modern modular products, but their exterior elevations are architecturally


similar to the 70-year-old neighborhood.


The second project is called CitiRama. CitiRama is a creative homes type promotion done with six


site-built homes and two of our Discovery custom homes also done by our builder partner Potterhill


Homes. These two projects are examples of how our new modular projects have expanded our


market for factory-built housing. These products have allowed us to open new lines of distribution


and reach new customers that are unavailable to us via our manufactured housing products. Also,


these new products allow us to leverage our abilities to build, distribute and finance affordable


customized homes to creditworthy buyers.


Last quarter we took a $0.12 per share charge to close 12 retail stores and idled one production


line. At that time, we indicated that we felt, we were starting the fourth quarter at a breakeven level


and that we should return to profitability again in fiscal year 2006.


Our fourth quarter results indicate that we are on schedule. Our net sales for the fourth quarter


were up 14% to a 147.7 million. Despite having 28 fewer company stores opened. Our margins


were flat despite a drop in our internalization rate from 68% to 55%. The internalization rate drop is


also due to fewer open stores. Our SG&A expense declined 5% and operational profits increased


188% from a loss of 3.4 million to a profit of 3 million.


Net income totaled 2 million for the quarter or $0.09 per share, which includes other income of 1.8


million after-tax for the gain on sale of real estate. For the year, we lost $0.17 a share compared to


a loss of $0.26 a share in the prior year. Excluding the one time third quarter charges of $0.12 a


share, the loss for this year was $0.05 a share versus $0.26 a share last year. We also had a 6%


increase in revenue to $611 million for the March year.

Industry wise, manufactured housing shipments were up 7% through March 2005 and modular


shipments continue to grow over last year’s levels. Manufactured housing shipments growth,


however, is uneven with California, Arizona and Florida up 40% collectively. Conversely, Texas and


North Carolina are off 13% and 11% respectively year-to-date. We think that 2005 will see the total


factory-built homes, that’s manufactured housing combined with modular housing, increase from


174,000 units in 2004 to 183,000 units in 2005, an increase of 5%.


Before I cover some of the operational details for the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Kelly


Tacke to review the numbers.


Kelly Tacke, Vice President – Finance, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Larry. Last quarter we told you that the rightsizing actions we took coupled with our


strong financial condition should position us to return to profitability regardless of the timing of the


industry recovery. And I am pleased to report that we did return to profitability this quarter and


ended the year in excellent financial condition.


We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of 46.2 million. Accounts receivable and new


home inventory for company-owned superstore and builder location increased 291,000 compared


to a year ago. Approximately 269,000 of the increase is the result of the rollout of our modular


products and higher raw material prices. The remainder of the increase is the result of consolidation


of product from our closed locations.


As you know, during the first quarter fiscal 2005, we issued 75 million of 3.25% convertible senior


notes, due 2024. We’ve used a portion of the proceeds to pay down our floor plan payable, which


totaled 30.9 million at the end of the year.


For the quarter, we sold 1,857 factory-built homes compared to 1,742 in the fourth quarter of last


year, an increase of 6.6%. Sales of modular homes increased 74% during the quarter and totaled


363 homes. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 14% to 147.7 million compared to 129.8


million in the fourth quarter of last year. During the year, we sold 7,948 factory-built homes, a


decrease of 3% compared to 8,216 homes a year ago. For the year, modular homes represented


over 17% of total homes sold compared to 12% last year. Net sales for the year increased 6% to


610.5 million compared to 578.5 million last year. New factory-built homes sold through company-


owned superstores and builder locations declined 19% during the year. Homes sold to independent


dealers and builders increased 34% during the year to 3,186 homes compared to 2,370 homes last


year.


Our fourth quarter gross margin of 26.4% was basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year, but


significantly better than the third quarter margin of 23.6%. Our gross margin for the year was 25.3%


compared to 26% last year. Clearly, the third quarter charges related to closing the sales centers


and streamlining regional operations adversely affected our gross margin. Record high raw material


prices, the availability of discounted repo, and the decline in our internalization rate continue to


impact our gross margin.


For the year, SG&A decreased 2.5 million to 154.9 million from 157.4 million last year. This


decrease reflects our continued focus on reducing our operating expenses offset by the charges in


the third quarter associated with closing the sales centers. For the fourth quarter SG&A totaled 36


million, a decrease of 1.9 million compared to last year and a decrease of 5.6 million compared to


the third quarter.


For the quarter, operating income was 3 million, compared to an operating loss of 3.4 million in the


fourth quarter of last year. For the year, we essentially broke even with an operating loss of


353,000 compared to an operating loss of 6.8 million last year.
