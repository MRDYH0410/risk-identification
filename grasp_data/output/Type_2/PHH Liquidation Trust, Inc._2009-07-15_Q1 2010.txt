MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to this Palm Harbor Homes Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal


2010 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and


introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Larry


Keener. Please go ahead, sir.


Larry Keener, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Tom. Good morning all and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on our end of the


call today are Kelly Tacke, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Greg


Aplin, President of CountryPlace Mortgage and Mr. Lyle Zeller, Executive Vice President of


CountryPlace.


Before we begin today, our attorneys have reminded me to remind you that all our comments today


are made within the context of the Safe Harbor rules, that past performance is no guarantee of


future results and that any comments about improving performance may not occur.


Now, on to the specifics of the quarter. Revenues for the first quarter were $82.4 million, a


decrease of 36.6% from prior year, which was $130 million. Sequentially, revenues were up by $3.5


million or 4.4% versus our fourth quarter. The revenue decline was driven by a 38.9% decline in


residential homes delivered offset by 3.8% increase in average sales price of all units delivered.


The average sales price increase was largely the result of $7.9 million in commercial and military


modular sales.


Gross margins were 23.4%, down 110 basis points from prior year at 24.6%. Gross margins were


impacted by $1.1 million in one-time charges associated with the closing of five retail locations and


the increase in reserves for incurred but not reported group medical expense.


Margins for the quarter would have been 24.7% without these one-time charges, slightly above


prior year. SG&A expense for the first quarter was 24.4 million compared to 31.2 million prior year,


a reduction of $6.8 million or 21.8%.


The SG&A expense decline resulted from the reduction of six operating sales centres and one


factory versus prior year in addition to a 35% head count decrease and a major decrease in fixed


expense for our ongoing operations.


Net loss for the quarter was $0.44 a share or $10 million. Approximately 1.4 million or $0.06 per


share of the loss was from non-cash charges and required accounting change in our interest


expense accounting. Kelly will have more on this in her comments.


A breakdown of the quarter without the one-time charges and the adoption of new accounting


standards for interest and equity on debentures would be: a revenue decline of 36.6%, flat gross


margins at 24.7%, a decrease in SG&A expense of $6.8 million or 21.8%, a decline in actual cash


interest expense of $593,000 or a 16% reduction, and a net loss of $7.4 million or $0.32 a share.


Perhaps more important than the year-over-year comparison is the progress that has been made


sequentially versus the fourth quarter. Revenues are up 4.5%, operating income improved 47.4%,


and positive operating cash flow from operations was $6.1 million.


Operating income improved principally due to the $4.4 million decrease in SG&A expense, fourth


quarter versus the first quarter. This decrease is consistent with our efforts the past 18 months to


drastically lower the company’s operating breakeven point. A year ago the company’s quarterly


breakeven point was $130 million in revenue. Given our first quarter results, the company’s current


operating breakeven point is now less than $100 million in quarterly revenues.

The difference between where we are today and breakeven is approximately 50 additional home


sales per month or a further reduction in SG&A expense of approximately – to approximately $20


million per quarter or obviously some combination of both. We are working at closing the gap


between revenue and expenses at both ends of the equation. I will discuss how later in the call, but


we’ll now turn the call over to Kelly to discuss the balance sheet and related items.


Kelly Tacke, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Larry. The financial story this quarter continues to be one about cash management. In light


of the current economic crisis and with no near-term signs of recovery for the factory-built housing


industry, our top priorities are cash generation and cash preservation in every area of our business.


Cash totaled 22.3 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 9.9 million since the beginning of


the fiscal year. Accounts receivable and new home inventory for company-owned retail and builder


location was approximately 1.1 million, a decrease of 20% compared to the first quarter of last year.


Consumer loans receivable totaled 188.9 million, a decline of 2.7 million since the beginning of the


fiscal year, which is due solely to customer payments. CountryPlace is currently servicing


approximately 3,000 loans with an average FICO score of 710, average down-payment of over


16% and an average balance of approximately 64,000.


Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased approximately 10.5 million since the beginning


of the fiscal year, 4.5 million of the increase is due to short-term promissory notes, which were


issued in April and paid off after the end of the quarter. 1.1 million is due to the closing of the five


retail locations and the group insurance accrual that Larry mentioned earlier and the remainder is


due solely to the timing of the quarter end. The convertible debt bears interest at 3.25 and is due


May 2024. However, the debenture holders may require us to repurchase the debt on certain dates,


the earliest of which is May 15, 2011.


Our floor plan agreement is with Textron, who announced during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 that


they are in the process of an orderly liquidation of their housing inventory finance business. In April


2009, we agreed to an amendment, which included a committed amount of 50 million, an expiration


date of March 31, 2009, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 700 basis points and new financial


covenants.


In June 2009, we agreed to a further amendment, which extends the expiration date to June 30,


2010 and lowers the committed amount from 50 million to 45 million, and further lowers it to 40


million upon the earlier of the sale of certain assets or December 31, 2009. We were in compliance


with all of our financial covenants as of the end of this quarter. While no absolute assurance can be


made, especially in light of the overall economic conditions, we expect to replace Textron before


the facility expires.


As Larry mentioned previously, interest expense included two non-cash charges totaling 1.4 million.


Approximately 600,000 relates to the adoption of FASB Staff Position APB 14-1. This position


requires that the liability and the equity component of our convertible debt be separately accounted


for in a way that reflects a non-convertible debt borrowing rate. This means that the equity


component is reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital and the debt is reduced by an


equal amount. This reduction in debt is treated as a debt discount, which will increase interest


expense over time and accrete the debt to its face value. At the end of the day, the adoption of APB


14-1 will have no impact on our total shareholders’ equity. It’s simply geographical movement


between paid-in capital and retained earnings.


The other non-cash item totals approximately 800,000 and relates to the valuation of the warrants


to purchase approximately 430,000 shares of common stock that we issued in connection with the
