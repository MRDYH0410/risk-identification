In addition our previously announced automation projects started up in January 2009, and has


been phased in to full operation. At the same time we have completed the upgrade of our line six


towel line, which has allowed us to increase productivity and efficiency.


As reported in the last quarter, on August 1, 2007, Orchids received a new wastewater discharge


permit that requires the company to expand its existing pretreatment facility to reduce biological


oxygen demand and total suspended solids from its discharge water. Under the permit the


company is required to complete the expansion and make operational the pretreatment facility by


August 1, 2009. We are proceeding with the engineering, and have purchased major equipment for


the project, and are on schedule for completion by July 2009.


We are encouraged by the positive impact of sustained improvement as a result of the coordinated


efforts of our management team and the Orchids workforce over the past year, and look forward to


continued efforts and results in 2009.


Now I will turn it over to Keith to discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Bob. I’m very pleased to announce we set quarterly records for sales and earnings in


both the fourth quarter and full-year results.


For the three months ended December 31, 2008, we reported net income of 2.3 million or $0.34 per


diluted share compared with net income of 850,000 or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period of


2007.


Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $24.3 million, an increase of 20% over the 20.3 million


in net sales we reported for the same period last year. Net sales of converted products in the fourth


quarter of 2008 increased 22% to 21.1 million, which was primarily the result of a 23% increase in


net selling prices. The price increase was primarily due to product content changes and actual


price increases taken during 2008 in response to increased waste paper and energy costs. Net


sales of parent rolls increased 7% to $3.3 million.


For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2008, our net income was 5.2 million or $0.79 per


diluted share compared with net income of 2.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the 2007 period.


Net sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008, were $90.2 million, an increase of 21%


compared with $74.6 million in the same period last year.


Converted product net sales in the 12-month period of 2008 increased 15% to 74.9 million primarily


due to an increase in the net selling price per ton compared to the 2007 period. Net sales of parent


rolls increased 65% in the 12 months ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period of


2007 due to a 43% increase in tonnage shipped and a 15% increase in selling prices.


Our improved results in the fourth quarter of 2008 were primarily the result of the 23% increase in


our net selling price per ton, which was somewhat offset by higher converting production costs.


Our net selling price per ton improved at $1,843 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with


$1,520 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2007.


The net selling price per ton of our converted products, which represented 87% of our total sales


revenue in the quarter, increased 23% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison and the net selling


price per ton of our parent rolls increased approximately 9%.
