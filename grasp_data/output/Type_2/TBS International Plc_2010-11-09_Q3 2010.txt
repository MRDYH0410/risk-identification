vessels. This regression has impacted the TBS fleet, especially our bulk carriers, and the trend is


continuing in quarter four 2010.


Our focus remains on sustaining cargo volumes and increasing market shares despite the


downturn in the market. Our business plan is to capitalize on the alliances TBS built during the past


year and continue to employ our Five Star Service, which will sustain viable growth for the future


while maintaining our competitive advantage.


We have an operational fleet of 49 vessels consisting of 27 tweendeckers and 22 handymax,


handysize bulk carriers with an aggregate of 1.48 million total deadweight. We were on track with


our goal to modernize and expand our fleet through our new building program of six multipurpose


tweendeck vessels, of which we have taken delivery of three so far. We anticipate the delivery of


remaining three vessels in 2011.


Now, I’d like to turn the floor over to Fred Lepere, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief


Financial Officer.


Ferdinand V. Lepere, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Joe. We should now all be on slide number three. This slide summarizes our third


quarter 2010 operating and financial highlights.


For the third quarter ending September 30th, 2010, total revenues were $99.8 million, an increase


of 34% over the same period in 2009. Voyage revenues for the three months ended September


30th, 2010 were $75.2 million, an increase of 31% from $57.2 million during the same period in


2009. Time charter revenues for the third quarter 2010 increased by $6.7 million to $22.7 million


from $16 million for the three months ended September 30th of 2009.


Our net loss for the third quarter 2010 was $10.4 million after non-controlling interest, an


improvement of 43% as compared to a net loss of $18.1 million during the same period last year.


Earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis for the third quarter 2010 was a loss of $0.34 per


share as compared to a loss of $0.61 per share for the third quarter of last year.


EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, was $21.9 million for the third quarter of 2010, an


increase of $11.4 million over the same period in 2009. A reconciliation of EBITDA is provided in


the appendix of this presentation.


During the third quarter, we drydocked five vessels for 155 drydocking days as compared to the


191 drydocking days in the third quarter of 2009.


Please now turn to slide number four. This slide demonstrates the revenue metrics of our business


for the third quarter 2010. We begin with our voyage business. During the third quarter of 2010, we


operated 33 vessels in our freight voyage business and had 3,024 freight voyage days as


compared to 29 vessels and 2,630 freight voyage days in Q3 2009.


Our daily average voyage time charter equivalent was $13,383, an increase of 9% compared to last


year’s third quarter. As you can see on this slide, during the third quarter of 2010, we had a 21%


increase in the total tons of cargo shipped and a 13% increase in the tons of cargo shipped


excluding aggregates. This increase is mainly due to an increase in steel and metal concentrate


cargoes transported.


We now turn to our time charter revenue metrics on the same slide. Our average daily time charter


equivalent for this business was $17,260 in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $6,212 from


the $11,048 during the same period of 2009, which is due to the higher average charter rates. We
