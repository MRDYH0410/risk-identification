MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AmericanWest


Bancorporation Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to the


host, Mr. Pat Rusnak, Chief Operating Officer of AmericanWest.


Patrick J. Rusnak, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer


Good morning and welcome to the AmericanWest Bancorporation third quarter earnings release


conference call. With me here this morning are Bob Daugherty, President and CEO, and Rick


Shamberger, Chief Credit Officer.


This call is being recorded and will be available for replay approximately one hour after its


conclusion and will be available for 30 days. The recording may be the accessed through our


website, at www.awbank.net/ir, or calling 877-407-0782 and entering the account number 286 and


conference ID #254521.


During this call, we may make statements regarding future events, performance targets or results


that are forward-looking in nature, which AmericanWest intends to be covered under the Private


Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that


could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors, which may cause


actual results to differ from expectations, are included in AmericanWest’s 2006 Form K filed with


the SEC on March 15, 2007. AmericanWest cautions investors not to place undue reliance upon


forward-looking statements and undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking


statements made during this conference call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.


I’ll begin with a review of our operating results for the third quarter. AmericanWest reported diluted


earnings per share of $0.31 for the third quarter of 2007, an increase of $0.23 or 288% over the


same period in 2006 and an increase of $0.05 or 19% on a linked quarter basis.


The third quarter 2006 financial results reflected a provision charge of 2.4 million or $0.13 per share


after-tax related to the charge-off of a single loan. Excluding the impact of this item, the third


quarter 2007 diluted EPS growth was $0.10, or a 48% increase.


As we expected, our financial performance metrics, ROA, ROE and efficiency ratio, all showed


continued improvement in the third quarter. The ROA was 1.03%, up 11 basis points from the prior


quarter. The ROE was 7.40%, up 94 basis points. The return on tangible shareholders’ equity was


15.26%, up 166 basis points. And the efficiency ratio of 63.4 reflected a 125-basis-point


improvement over the second quarter of 2007.


It was a relatively clean quarter with only a few non-recurring items, which impacted third quarter


results and netted to $115,000, or $0.01 per diluted share after-tax; approximately, $130,000 of


positive tax adjustments related to the 2006 tax return, which was filed during the third quarter


2007; and a gain of 82,000 on an OREO property, which had no carrying value, were partially offset


by a pre-tax legal settlement of $80,000. No additional legal settlements are anticipated during the


remainder of 2007.


The tax equivalent net interest margin for the third quarter of 2007 was 5.22%, down 15 basis


points on a linked quarter basis and up 19 basis points from the third quarter of 2006. This is


roughly in line with our expectations noted on last quarter’s call and the decrease principally driven


by increase in funding costs. The average yield on loans for the third quarter of 2007 was 8.45%,


down 4 basis points on the linked quarter basis and up 29 basis points from a year-ago.

Loan fees comprised 38 basis points of the total yield for the third quarter of 2007 unchanged from


the previous quarter and 4 basis points less than the same period in 2006. Net deferred loan fees


represented about 21 basis points of total loans at September 30, 2007, up 1 basis point from June


30 and 11 basis points over the yearend 2006 level.


The third quarter loan yield was negatively impacted as a result of one large loan relationship being


placed on non-accrual status at the end of the second quarter and a reduction in index rates on


some variable rate loans effective as a result of a 50-basis-point Fed easing on September 19. The


former of these two factors reflects the loss of current income and not the reversal of previously


recognized drop.


These items decreased in the third quarter average yield on loans by approximately 4 and 3 basis


points, respectively. The average rate exclusive of fees for new loans booked during the third


quarter of 2007 was 8.18% compared to 8.40 during the second quarter. Fixed rate loans


represented only about 22% of the production for the third quarter with an average rate of 7.74. The


average rate for new and variable rate for just – for new variable rate production was 8.3.


As of September 30, 2007, approximately 47% of the portfolio was indexed to prime with a reset of


rates less than three months, with the balance of the portfolio split about evenly between hybrid


adjustable and fixed rate loans. The fixed rate loans have an average remaining contraction


maturity of approximately eight years.


The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits for the third quarter of 2007 both


increased by 11 basis points over the second quarter. These increases are principally due to the


bulk of our 40 million of average deposit growth in the third quarter coming in the higher cost money


market and CD categories.


Money market increased on average 17 million and CD growth was 33 million on average. Non-


interest-bearing DDA grew about 2 million on average basis for the third quarter and comprised


about 23% of average total deposits for the third quarter, down slightly from the previous quarter.


Our projections for the margin for the fourth quarter assuming no further Fed movement on short-


term rates is in the range 5.15 to 5.20. We anticipate continued pressure on deposit costs, as


existing customers continue to migrate to higher rate products, and deposit growth lags projected


loan growth.


We have not yet seen any significant pricing power opportunities as the result of the recent capital


markets turmoil. Although some of the competition has abated, large banks are still to be – appear


to still be actively pursuing deals with relatively tight pricing.


The impact of a 25-basis-point reduction in the Fed Funds target rate on their net interest margin


based on our current model assumptions is approximately 7 basis points. We took some fairly


aggressive steps to lower both non-maturity and CD rates after the Fed easing last month. For


example, our money market rate tiers will lower by 25 to 50 basis points, and CD rates were


lowered by about 40 basis points without any quantifiable customer reaction to-date.


We plan to take similar actions with rate adjustments on deposits, should the Fed further reduce the


Fed Funds target rate during the fourth quarter. Our most recent asset liability simulation model


continues to reflect the modest level of asset sensitivity.


[inaudible] 200-basis-point scenario, net interest income is expected to increase by about 5% in the


rates up environment and decrease by about the same amount in rates down. We recognize the


provision for credit losses of 1.3 million for the third quarter of 2007, or 29 basis points of average


loans annualized compared to 43 basis points on an annualized basis in the second quarter of


2007 and a 123 basis points for the third quarter of 2006.
