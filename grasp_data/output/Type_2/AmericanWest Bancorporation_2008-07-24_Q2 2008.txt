Please go ahead.


Patrick J. Rusnak, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Andrea. Good morning and welcome to the American West Bancorporation’s Second


Quarter financial results conference call. With me this morning is Bob Daugherty, President, CEO,


Rick Shamberger, our Chief Credit Officer, Bob Harris, EVP and Director of Commercial Banking


for our Washington and Idaho markets, and Nicole Sherman, our EVP and Director of Retail


Banking.


This call is being recorded and will be available for replay approximately one hour after its


conclusion and will be available for 30 days. The recording may be accessed through our website


www.awbank.net/ir or by calling 877-344-7529 and entering the passcode 421755#.


During this call, we may make statements regarding future events, performance targets, or results


that are forward-looking in nature which AmericanWest intends to be covered under the Private


Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that


could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors which may cause actual


results to differ from expectations are included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4th,


2008. AmericanWest cautions investors not to place undue reliance upon forward-looking


statements and undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements made


during this conference call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.


I’ll begin this morning with a review of our operating results for the second quarter which included a


net after-tax loss of 6.2 million or $0.36 per share. This compares with a net loss of 4.6 million or


$0.26 per share exclusive of the $27 million goodwill impairment charge for the first quarter and net


income of 4.5 million or 26 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2007. The results for the


second quarter of 2008 reflect a provision for loan losses of 16.4 million, which will be addressed


more specifically later in our prepared remarks.


The tax equivalent net interest margin for the second quarter of 2008 was 4.19%, down 43 basis


points from the first quarter of 2008 and down a 118 basis points from the second quarter of 2007.


The impact of loans moved to non-accrual status during the second quarter of 2008, on the margin,


was approximately 13 basis points. This, combined with the 25 basis point Fed easing subsequent


to last quarter’s call the principal reasons why the second quarter margin is below our forecast


range.


The average yield on loan for the second quarter of 2008 was 6.69%, down 72 basis points from


the first quarter of 2008 and down 180 basis points from the second quarter of 2007. The reduction


in the average yield was due in part to repricing of approximately 784 million in variable rate loans,


most of which are indexed prime. Loan fees comprised 28 basis points of total average loan yield


for the second quarter as compared to 30 basis points for the first quarter of 2008 and 38 basis


points for the second quarter of 2007.


Net deferred loan fees represented about 16 basis points of total loans at June 30, 2008, as


compared to 18 basis points at March 31st. A substantial portion of our deferred loan fees are from

construction and development loans. As origination of these types of loans has been significantly


curtailed, we expect that the contribution of fees to loan yield and the level of net deferred fees will


both decline over the balance of 2008 we mentioned on last quarter’s call. The average rate


exclusive of fees for new loans booked during the second quarter of 2008 was 5.98% as compared


to 6.42% in the first quarter of 2008. Average prime rate for the second quarter was down 115 basis


points from the first quarter of 2008.


Fixed rate loans represented about 32% of the production for the first quarter with an average rate


of 6.7%. The average rate for second quarter 2008 new variable and adjustable rate loan


production was 5.8% as composed -- compared to 6.29% for the first quarter of 2008. The average


cost of interest bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2008 decreased by 28 basis points


compared to the first quarter of 2008 and 80 basis points for the same period a year ago. Average


deposits increased 57 million as compared to the first quarter of 2008 along with the ending


balance increasing 27 million as compared to March 31st 2008.


The average CDs as compared to the first quarter increased by 77 million, the increase principally


driven by growth in the brokered CD category which totaled 241 million at June 30th representing


about 15% of total deposits. Approximately 188 million of this amount mature prior to the end this


year. The growth in CDs was partially offset by a decline in average savings and money market


accounts of 15 million. Average non-interest bearing deposits were 20% of average total deposits


for the second quarter as compared to 21% for the first quarter of 2008 and 23% for the same


period last year. We recognize a provision for loan losses of 16.4 million for the second quarter of


2008 or 368 basis points of average loans annualized as compared to 12.8 million or 289 basis


points for the first quarter of 2008 and 1.5 million or 38 basis points for the second quarter of 2007.


Rick will cover this area in more detail in a few minutes with his asset quality update.


Non-interest income was 5.1 million for the second quarter of 2008, up 21% on a linked quarter


basis and 9% over the same period 2007. The increase over the first quarter is primarily due to


growth in mortgage loan sale revenue which increased 396,000 or 46%, paying fees on certain


service charges on deposit which increased 294,000 or 12%. The increase in fees and service


charges is due mainly to increased overdraft and NSF deposit service charges and growth in debit


card income.


Mortgage banking revenue volumes have increased as expected in the second quarter. We


continue to experience success with the recruitment of experienced mortgage lenders in all of our


markets. During the second quarter of 2008 there were $61,000 of revenue recorded related to


SBA loan sales with no gains in the first quarter of 2008 or the same period in 2007.


Non-interest expense for the second quarter 2008 totaled 19.2 million as compared to 18.8 million


for the first quarter of 2008 exclusive of the $27 million goodwill impairment charge. As discussed


on last quarter’s call, the impairment charge did not have any impact on our regulatory capital


ratios, liquidity or cash flows. We’ve engaged an independent consulting firm to conduct an


evaluation of goodwill impairment as of September 30th which is our annual valuation date. Given


the reduction in the market capitalization since March 31 it’s possible that an additional impairment


charge may be recognized in the third quarter. Other non-interest expense increased by 730,000,


as compared to the first quarter. This increase is principally due to FDIC deposit insurance


premiums of 259,000 as a result of our onetime credit being fully utilized during the first quarter and


an increase in legal expenses associated mainly with the work out of troubled credits increasing by


213,000.


Equipment and occupancy expenses increased by 204,000 as compared to the first quarter, mainly


related to technology costs incurred at the least newly support center and other technology


improvements throughout the bank including a new automated wire transfer platform that provides


us with significantly enhanced VSA and AML compliance capabilities.
