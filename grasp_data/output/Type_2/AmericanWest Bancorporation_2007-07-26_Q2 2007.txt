MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AmericanWest Bancorporation


Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to


introduce your host Mr. Pat Rusnak, Chief Operating Officer of AmericanWest. Thank you. You


may begin.


Patrick J. Rusnak, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer


Good morning and welcome to the AmericanWest Bancorporation Second Quarter Earnings


Release Conference Call. With me this morning are Bob Daugherty, President and CEO; and Rick


Shamberger, our Chief Credit Officer. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay


approximately 1 hour after its conclusion. The recording may be accessed through our website at


www.awbank.net/ir; or calling 8776606853 and entering the account, account 286 and conference


ID #246999.


During this call, we may make statements regarding future events, performance targets or results


that are forward-looking in nature which AmericanWest intends to be covered under the Private


Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that


could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors which may cause actual


results to differ from expectations are included in AmericanWest 2006 Form K filed with the SEC on


March 15, 2007. AmericanWest cautions investors from placing undue reliance upon forward-


looking statements and undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements


made during this conference call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.


I’ll begin this morning with a review of our operating results for the quarter. AmericanWest reports


diluted earnings per share of 26 cents for the first quarter, excuse me, second quarter of 2007, an


increase of 2 cents or 8% from the same period in 2006 and an increase of 7 cents or 37% on a


link-quarter basis. As we expected, our financial performance metrics, ROI, ROE and efficiency


ratio all improved significantly during the second quarter. The ROA was 0.92, up 29 basis points


from the prior quarter. ROE was 6.46 of 71 basis points. Return on tangible shareholder’s equity


was 13.6, up 580 basis points. And efficiency ratio of 64.7 reflected a 14% fiscal improvement over


the first quarter of 2007. This significant improvement in operating performance is principally due to


3 factors: the impact of the merger with Far West Bancorporation which was completed on April 1;


solid organic loan growth; and the staff reductions implemented during the first quarter of 2007. The


Far West merger was accretive to EPS in the first quarter of combined operations.


It was a relatively clean quarter with only a few nonrecurring items which impacted second quarter


results and netted a $50,000 reduction in net income after tax. Approximately 263,000 of merger


related expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of Oreo and bank properties totaling a


$189,000. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the quarter was 5.37, up 68 basis points on a


link-quarter basis and 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2006. The margin was favorably


impacted by the merger with Far West as we had expected. The additional Far West higher yielding


loan portfolio and low-cost quarter deposit base was the principal reason for the second quarter


margin expansion. The impact of purchase accounting, accretion and amortization related to loans


and deposits acquired in the Far West merger is not material, resulted in an increase in net interest


income of about $80,000 or 2 basis points for the quarter. So with no adverse impact from the


reversal of interest income for loans based on non-accrual status during the second quarter.


The average yield on loans for the second quarter of 2007 was 8.49%, up 47 basis points on a link-


quarter basis and up 48 basis points from a year ago. As we reported in our first quarter conference


call, the margin and loan yield were both impacted by an adjustment to our accounting for deferred


fees on loans for the contraction maturities of 1 year or less. The impact of this change in the first


quarter margin was approximately 25 basis points. We expect the impact of this change to diminish

over the next several quarters as the level of fees accretion increases. This is evident by the


contribution of loan fees through a loan yield which increased from 21 basis points in the first


quarter of 2007 to 38 basis points in Q2. By comparison, these represented 42 basis points of the


total loan yield for the second quarter of 2006.


The average rate exclusive of these for new loans booked during the second quarter of 2007 was


8.40, with variable or adjustable rate loans at 8.66, and fixed rate loans at 7.83%. Fixed rate loans


represented only about 31% of the total production for the second quarter, which is consistent with


recent quarters and our overall portfolio mix. The merger with Far West resulted in some changes


to the loan portfolio mix composition. As of June 30th, 2007, approximately 46% of the loan


portfolio was indexed to prime, with a reset of less than three months, and the balance of the


portfolio split about evenly between hybrid adjustable and fixed rate loans.


The fixed rate loans have an average contractual maturity of approximately 8 years. The average


cost of interest bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2007 was 3.53%, which was down 27


basis points linked quarter, and up 37 basis points from the first quarter of 2006. The average cost


of deposits for the second quarter of 2007 was 2.71%, down 35 basis points from the first quarter.


The decrease in the average cost of deposits and the average cost of interest bearing deposits for


the second quarter 2007 is principally due to the Far West bank acquisition. A non-interest bearing


DDA comprised approximately 23% of total deposits to June 30th, as compared with 18.6% at


March 31st, 2007.


Our projection for the margin for the balance of the year, assuming no fed change on short-term


rates is in the range of 5.15 to 5.25%. The interest may continue pressure on deposit cost as


existing customers migrate to higher rate products, and the deposit growth as we expect will


continue to lie in projected loan growth. Loan price in Utah originations continues to exceed


comparable pricing in our Washington hotigen markets by approximately 50 basis points, excluding


loan fees.


Our asset liability simulation model, updated for the merger requirements continues to reflect a


modest level of asset sensitivity under against 200 basis point scenario, and this income is


expected to increase by about 5% in a rates up environment, and decrease by about 6% in rates


down.


We recognize the provision for credit losses is 1.8 million for the second quarter of 2007, for 43


basis points of average loans annualized, compared with 24 basis points of annualized loans for


the same period in 2006. No provision for loan losses was recognized during the first quarter of


2007. Our year-to-date annualized provision for loan losses and net charge offs were in line with


our previous expectations. Rick Shamberger will cover this area in a little more detail in a few


minutes with his affect quality update.


Non-interest income for the second quarter of 2007 was 4.7 million, and included net gains of


189,000 on the sale of OREO and bank property which I mentioned earlier. The growth and non-


interest income was driven principally by increased deposit service charges of 1.1 million, an 80%


increase, increased mortgage banking revenue of about 600,000, or 148%, and increased bank on


life insurance income of 154,000. The growth and service charge revenue was principally due to


the Far West merger, which represented 84% of the growth. Service charge growth excluding the


Far West acquisition was 177,000, or 16%, and was driven mainly by increased debit card revenue.


The growth in mortgage banking revenue was primarily due to the Far West acquisition and


significant additions made to our Washington and Idaho residential lending teams during the first


quarter.


Despite increases in mortgage rates, our residential mortgage production increased by 16 million or


50% over the first quarter of 2007. The prospects for residential mortgage lending for the balance of


the year look favorable given the continued housing market strength in Utah and northern Idaho.
