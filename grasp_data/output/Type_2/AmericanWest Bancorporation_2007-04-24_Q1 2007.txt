MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Greetings ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AmericanWest Bancorporation First


Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A


brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a


reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Pat


Rusnak, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Thank you Mr. Rusnak, you may


now begin.


Patrick J. Rusnak, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer


Thank you. Good morning and welcome to AmericanWest Bancorporation’s First Quarter Earnings


Release Conference Call. With me this morning are Bob Daugherty, President and CEO and Rick


Shamberger, our Chief Credit Officer. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay


approximately one hour after its conclusion. Your recording maybe accessed through our website


at www.awbank.net/ir or calling 877-660-6853 and entering account # 286 and conference ID #


237898.


During this call we may make statements regarding future events, performance, targets or expected


results that are forward-looking in nature, which AmericanWest intends to be covered under the


Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ


materially from those projected. Factors which may cause actual results to differ from expectations


are included in AmericanWest’s 2006 Form 10-K filed with the SEC.


AmericanWest cautions investors not to place undue reliance upon forward-looking statements and


undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements made during this


conference call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.


I will begin this morning with a review of our operating results for the quarter. AmericanWest


reported diluted earnings per share of $0.19 for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $0.4 or 27%


over the same period in 2006.


Included in the first quarter 2007 results were a few significant non-recurring items, which netted to


about $0.02 per share after-tax. Severance costs associated with the staff reduction of $0.02 and


merger-related expenses of $0.01 after-tax. Offset by an after-tax OREO gain of $0.01 per share.


The tax equivalent net interest margin for the first quarter of 2007 was 4.69, down 33 basis points


on a linked-quarter basis and down 46 basis points in the first quarter of 2006. The average yield


on loans for the first quarter of 2007 was 8.02%, down 20 basis points on a linked-quarter basis


and up 40 basis points from a year ago.


As indicated in the press release, the margin was impacted by an adjustment in our accounting for


deferred loan fees under FAS 91. This change accounted for about 25 of the 33 basis points of


compression from the fourth quarter of 2006.


The impact to the change in accounting for deferred fees is of course only a timing difference.


Given the fact that the change was made only for loans with maturity of one year or less, principally


construction loans, the impact on the loan yield will diminish over time.


Although less than 20% of fees deferred on a short maturity loan was originated during the first


quarter of this change were recognized an income. By the end of 2007 over 50% of the total fees


deferred on short-term loans will have been recognized through the income statement.

The offset to the deferral of loans fees is the deferral direct origination costs. Unlike fee deferrals


which flow through the loan yield on a delayed basis, deferred costs will result in a reduction of the


loan yield on a permanent basis with a corresponding decrease in compensation expense.


For the first quarter of 2007 the deferred costs increased by approximately 440,000 over the fourth


quarter of 2006. The average rate, excluding these, for new loans booked during the first quarter of


2007 was 8.97 with variable and adjustable rate loans at 9.17% and fixed rate loans at 8.29%.


Fixed rate loans represented only about a quarter of the total production for the first quarter of


2007.


The average cost of interest bearing deposits for the first quarter of 2007 was 3.80%, up 17 basis


points linked-quarter and up 97 basis points from the first quarter of 2006.


The interest sensitivity position for AmericanWest on a standalone basis did not change materially


during the first quarter. We continue to have a modest asset sensitivity as of 3/31. The addition of


Far West will have a significant impact on our margin in a positive way and given their loan pricing


mix will also increase our asset sensitivity, as approximately two-thirds of the Far West loan


portfolio is immediately re-priced to prime.


We’re still in the process of finalizing the purchased accounting adjustments for the Far West


merger. We will not be providing any specific margin guidance until the release of our second


quarter results. We did not take a loan loss provision for the first quarter of 2007 principally due to


the reductions in non-performing loans and potential problem loans. Rick Shamberger will cover


this area in a little more detail in a few minutes with his asset quality update.


Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2007 was 2.4 million and included $166,000 gain on the


sale of an OREO property, which had no carrying value. The growth in non-interest income was


driven principally by increased deposit service charges of 224,000, increased mortgage banking


revenue of 62,000 and the increase in bank-owned life insurance income of 126,000.


The increase in deposit service charges was driven principally by our debit card initiatives, which


resulted in increased interchange fees of 138,000 over the same period in 2006.


The bank-owned life insurance revenue for the first quarter of 2006 included the impact of some


non-recurring adjustments, which principally represents the difference between the two periods.


Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2007 was 13.8 million, an increase of 2.1 million or 18%


over the same period in 2006. This variance was principally due to the increased compensation


expense of 1.5 million, which was mostly driven by increased staffing levels associated with the


Columbia Trust Bancorp acquisition, which was completed in March of 2006 and four new financial


centers opened since the second quarter of last year.


Compensation expense for the first quarter of 2007 also includes 364,000 of severance costs


associated with our recently announced expense reduction initiative and about 100,000 for stock


options granted to outside directors. With respect to the latter, a similar grant for last year occurred


in April and was consequently a second quarter item instead of first quarter.


Compensation expense for Q1 2007 was reduced by approximately 400,000 due to the deferral of


certain loan origination costs associated with loans with terms of one year or less. As discussed


earlier, this expense will be amortized in the yield adjustment over the term of the underlying loans.


Non-interest expense was positively impacted by a reduction in foreclosed assets expense, which


declined due to a write-down of 340,000 taken in the first quarter of 2006.
