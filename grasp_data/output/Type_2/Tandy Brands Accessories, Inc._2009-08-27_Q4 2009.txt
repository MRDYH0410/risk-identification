So with this done, I’d like to introduce Rod McGeachy, our President, CEO and Chairman of the


Board. Rod?


N. Roderick McGeachy, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks Craig and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your


interest in the company. On the call today, I’ll have some brief introductory comments and then


Craig will go into more detail regarding the financial results for fiscal year 2009. After that, I will


review several key developments that happened at Tandy Brands over the past year. Then I will


discuss the company’s key initiatives for 2010 and lastly we will open the call to your questions.


For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, Tandy Brands Accessories reported a net loss of $15.1


million, or $2.18 per share, on net sales of $129 million. In fiscal, 2008 the company reported a net


loss of $49.3 million, or $7.18 per share, on net sales of $149.3 million. The fiscal 2009 results


include a non-cash inventory write-down of $6.9 million, a provision for doubtful accounts


receivable of $1.1 million and a charge of $774,000 associated with the corporate restructuring that


was announced in January 2009. The fiscal 2008 results include non-cash impairment charges and


inventory write-downs totaling $36.5 million.


Fiscal year 2009 was one of tremendous change here at Tandy Brands. I am encouraged by the


progress we have made and the positive effect these changes are having on the company’s


performance. Nonetheless, the weak economic environment and the related soft retail climate had


a significant impact on our results in 2009.


As consumers cut back on spending, our retail partners have responded accordingly by greatly


reducing inventory. But despite these macro economic headwinds, we believe we are well


positioned for a successful turnaround. We have made great strides in stabilizing our operating


platform, solidifying our balance sheet and improving our cash cycle. We have also established


some solid new profitable growth platforms that we expect to generate between 8 and 12% growth

in fiscal year 2010. I’ll go into more detail on this later but first Craig will give a more detailed


review of our financial results.


M.C. Mackey, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Rod. To reiterate fiscal 2009 results, Tandy Brands Accessories reported a net loss of


$15.1 million, or $2.18 per share, on net sales of $129 million. For fiscal 2008, the company


reported net loss of $49.3 million, or $7.18 per diluted share, on net sales of $129.3 million. The


2009 results included charges of approximately $8.8 million related to inventory write-downs,


doubtful accounts receivable associated with financial difficulties and bankruptcies of certain


customers and charges associated with the corporate restructuring announced in January.


The fiscal 2008 results include non-cash impairment charges and inventory write-downs totaling


$36.5 million. For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we reported a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.36


per share, on net sales of $26.4 million. This compares to a net loss of $4.7 million, or $0.67 per


share, on net sales of $30.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.


Regarding some of the key line items of 2009 operation statement -- net sales. The decline in net


sales in 2009 of approximately $20 million was primarily due to the ongoing weak retail


environment which resulted in reduced sales for our customers. In response to these conditions


our retail partners continued to maintain extremely conservative approach to inventory


replenishment and several cut back on anticipated store expansion plans or closed some of their


stores.


In addition, our net sales results were negatively affected by certain customers such as Goody’s


and Mervyn’s that filed bankruptcy and we estimated that 2009 sales results were reduced by


approximately $1.5 million, or 1.2% of net sales, as a result of that.


In 2009, our biggest selling category was once again the belts, with net sales of $74 million or 58%


net sales. The sales related to our gift business grew 11% in 2009 to $23 million, or 18% of total


sales. Our gift business continues to excel as gift sales have grown from $14 million in 2005 to $23


million, an annual growth rate of 16%. Small leather goods, primarily men’s and women’s wallets,


generated net sales of $22 million in 2009 and accounted for 17% of sales. Other product net sales


of $9 million made up the remaining 7% of sales.


Private label sales accounted for 60% of sales in 2009. Our proprietary brands featuring Amity,


Rolfs, Canterbury, Prince Gardner, Princess Gardner and Surplus, generated 20% of sales in 2009.


Our licensed brands generated 20% of sales in fiscal 2009 with the majority of these revenues


generated by our Totes gift business.


Regarding customers 00 Wal-Mart continues to be our largest customer, accounting for 43% of our


sales in 2009 and 41% of sales in 2008. Our second largest customer in 2009 was Khol’s, which


accounted for 10% of net sales. Our top 10 customers accounted for 74% of net sales in 2009 and


76% in 2008.


Our overall on gross margin was 30.7% in 2009, versus 21.9% in 2008. Inventory write-downs


negatively impacted gross margin about 5.4% in 2009. SG&A expenses for 2009 were $53 million


versus $56.6 million in 2008. Included in the 2009 SG&A expense is a $1.1 million provision for


doubtful accounts receivable and a charge of $774,000 associated with the corporate restructuring


announced in January. Over the past two years, we have reduced total SG&A expense by more


than $8 million.
