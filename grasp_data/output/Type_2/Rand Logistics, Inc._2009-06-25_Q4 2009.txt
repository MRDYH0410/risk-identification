MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Rand Logistics Fourth Quarter 2009


Conference Call. At this time I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and


that all participants are currently in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the conference over


to Melissa Dixon at The Equity Group, Investor Relations for Rand Logistics. Please go ahead


ma’am.


Melissa Dixon, Sr. Account Executive, The Equity Group, Inc.


Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Rand Logistics fiscal


2009 fourth quarter and year end conference call.


On the call today from the Company are Laurence Levy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed


Levy, Rand’s President; Scott Bravener, President of Lower Lakes; and Joe McHugh, Rand’s Chief


Financial Officer. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the Rand website


at www.randlogisticsinc.com.


Before we begin we would like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain forward-


looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995


concerning Rand Logistics, Inc. and its operating subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements are


statements that are not historical facts, but instead statements based upon the current beliefs and


expectations of the management of Rand Logistics.


Such forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could also cause


actual results to differ from the results included in such forward-looking statements. Rand assumes


no obligation to revise any forward-looking projections that may be made in today’s release or call.


And with that I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Laurence Levy. Laurence, please go


ahead.


Laurence S. Levy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Melissa and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call.


After my opening remarks Scott Bravener, President of Lower Lakes, will discuss our operating


results and Joe McHugh our CFO will review the financial results. I will then summarize the


prospects for the current shipping season and we will open the call up for questions.


We are very pleased with our record financial and operational results for the fiscal year ended


March 31, 2009. The Company’s financial results were its best ever despite the deterioration in the


macroeconomic environment and the credit markets, particularly in the second half of the fiscal


year.


We believe that this strong performance is attributable to our low cost operating model, the diversity


of our customer base, the barriers to entry in our markets and the infrastructure investments that


we have made in the Company.


In fiscal 2009 we were able to successfully integrate recent acquisitions into our fleet, complete the


repowering of the Saginaw on time and on budget and conclude the infrastructure investments that


we deemed necessary to enable us to effectively manage and grow the Company. These actions,


along with our ongoing focus on operational improvements, have resulted in an increase in


operating income of $18.7 million as compared to fiscal 2008.

As reported, operating income in fiscal 2009 was $9.3 million which included $10.6 million of


depreciation and amortization expense versus a $9.4 million operating loss which included $10.2


million of depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2008.


Now I’d like to turn the call over to Scott for a review of our operations. Scott?


Captain Scott Bravener, President of Lower Lakes Towing and Lower Lakes Transportation


Company


Thanks, Laurence. We are pleased with the operational performance of our vessels during fiscal


2009. Marine freight revenue per sailing day increased by 10.7% to $27,266 for the year ended


March 31, 2009 as compared to $24,622 in the prior year.


The increase in marine freight revenue per sailing day in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was


attributable to four primary factors: The full integration of the recently acquired vessels into our


fleet, which provided for a full sailing season for all of the new vessels. As we have discussed


previously, we are pleased with the performance of these vessels in terms of both revenue


generation and contribution to our operating income per sailing day; improved vessel utilization


during the fiscal 2009 shipping season due to greater scheduling flexibility and backhaul


opportunities; increased demand for marine shipping through the first half of the fiscal year; and


improved freight rates on new and renewed contracts as well as contractual rate increases from


existing contracts.


Fuel and other surcharges per sailing day increased by 87.1% to $9,258 for the year ended March


31, 2009 as compared to $4,949 in the prior fiscal year. Vessel operating expenses in fiscal 2009


before repairs and maintenance were 81.3 million or $25,841 per sailing day versus 69.1 million or


$23,974 per sailing day last fiscal year.


The increase in vessel operating expenses is due to higher fuel cost, excluding which our daily


vessel operating cost would have decreased. The decrease in daily operating cost was attributable


to cost reductions and operating efficiencies realized as we deployed our operating model across


the acquired vessels.


Repairs and maintenance expenses, which consist of expensed winterwork, increased 1.3 million to


5.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 from 3.8 million during the fiscal year ended


March 31, 2008. The increase was caused by $888,000 of expenses carried over from the fiscal


2008 winterwork into the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as compared to a carryover of only $87,000 in


fiscal 2008 and $754,000 of lay-up and fit-out expense.


The substantial improvement in operating income was attributable to several factors, including


reduced daily operating cost, better vessel utilization, improved operating metrics as a result of


prior year capital investments, and the application of our operating philosophy to the acquired


vessels.


Sailing days in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 increased by 265 days to 3,148 from 2,883 in


the prior fiscal year. 244 of the increased days were due to the addition of the former Voyageur


boat for the full season. 329 of the increased sailing days resulted from the former WMS vessels,


which were impacted by a strike in the fiscal 2008 sailing season. Offsetting these gains were 233


days associated with Calumet, which was retired in November 2007, and 75 days net attributable to


the balance of the fleet.


Additionally, fiscal 2009 sailing days were negatively impacted by the early cessation of shipments


in December 2008 at several customer facilities, reflecting weakening economic conditions. As
