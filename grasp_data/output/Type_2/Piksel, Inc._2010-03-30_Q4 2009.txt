Thank you, Kaleil. It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to address you today. As Kaleil


mentioned, it was a strong fourth quarter for KIT. Revenue in the quarter increased 46% to a record


$16.1 million from a previous record of $11 million – in the previous quarter and it increased 79%


from $9 million in the same quarter a year ago.


For the full year 2009, revenue increased 102% to a record $47.3 million from a previous record of


$23.4 million in 2008. Our revenues are primarily comprised of software license and maintenance


fees, software set-up fees, and professional service charges related to technical integration and


creative service.


For the Q4 of 2009, after recognizing the noncash accounting impact of accounting standard ASC


815-40, net loss was 15.6 million or $1.50 per basic and diluted share. This compares to a net loss


in the previous quarter of $11.1 million or $1.65 per basic and diluted share, and a net loss in the


fourth quarter of 2008 of $2.5 million or $0.75 per basic and diluted share. As everyone should

know by now, the GAAP standard requires us to book the increased Black-Scholes-Merton value of


our outstanding warrants, which results from the stock price increases quarter-on-quarter as a


noncash loss.


The application of this standard has a perverse effect on the company’s – as the company performs


and its stock appreciates and this is a major reason behind us repurchasing most of our


outstanding warrants during the first quarter, something I will address in more detail shortly.


For more information on the accounting standard, please reference the supplemental portion of


today’s press release.


So back to the numbers. Net loss for Q4 included: one, the noncash derivative expense of $8.2


million resulting from the application of ASC 815-40 accounting standard; two, $3 million in noncash


charges, including $834,000 in stock-based compensation, $1.6 million of depreciation and


amortization and $500,000 of impairment of intangible assets; three, $4.7 million in restructuring


and integration expenses primarily related to employee termination, acquisition-related facility


closing costs and other costs related to the reorganization and the integration of companies


acquired during Q2 and Q4; four, $1.3 million in direct merger and acquisitions and investor related


expenses, including legal, auditing fees, as well as fees to investment banking advisors and


intermediaries including in this, is $443,000 of seller fees from the acquisition of Nunet.


For the full year 2009, after recognizing the noncash accounting impact of the ASC 815-40


accounting standard, net loss was $19.9 million or negative $3.03 per basic and diluted share. This


compares to a net loss of $19 million or negative $7.55 per basic and diluted share in 2008.


Net loss for 2009 included; one, a noncash derivative expense of $6 million resulting from the


application of the ASC 815-40 accounting standard; two, $6.6 million in noncash charges, including


1.9 million in stock-based compensation, $4.2 million of depreciation and amortization and


$500,000 of impairment of intangible assets; three, $7 million in restructuring and integration


expenses, primarily related to the employee termination, acquisition-related facility closing costs


and other costs related to the reorganization and integration of acquired companies; four, $2.5


million in direct, merger and acquisition and investor relation related expenses, including legal and


auditing fees as well as fees to investment banking advisors. And intermediaries including in this is


$443,000 of seller’s fees from the acquisition of Nunet.


The impact of noncash charges and M&A activity during 2009 underlines the importance of


analyzing actual operating cash flow, our operating EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric we acquired to


enforce management discipline and cash flow focus.


For the quarter, operating EBITDA increased 240% to a record $3.2 million or $0.31 per basic and


diluted share from a $927,000 or $0.14 per basic and diluted share in the previous quarter, and


increased from $32,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008.


For the full year 2009, operating EBITDA was a record $4.9 million or $0.74 per basic and diluted


share, an improvement from an operating EBITDA loss of $7.2 million or a negative $2.88 per basic


and diluted share in 2008.


Now turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009, totaled $6.8


million, as compared to $5.9 million at December 31, 2008. As you know from our recent financing


activities and the market communications, our current cash level as we sit here today is


substantially higher.


Pro forma of the equity and cash outlays related to the Multicast Media acquisition, and the warrant


repurchase program, we estimate they will be between 17.5 and 18 million as-diluted shares


outstanding, and approximately $15 million in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.
