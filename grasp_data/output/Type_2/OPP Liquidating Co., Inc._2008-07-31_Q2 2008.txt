With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Bob Snyder.


Robert A. Snyder, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Keith. I am Bob Snyder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Orchids Paper products.


It’s great to speak with you again. In the second quarter of 2008, we achieved net sales of over


22.3 million, up 21% from last year’s second quarter, and earnings per share of $0.14 per diluted


share, a $0.02 per share increase over the second quarter of 2007.


For the first six months of 2008, we achieved net sales of nearly 42.6 million, up 21% from the first


six months of last year, and earning per share more than doubled to $0.23 per diluted share.


In the second quarter of 2008, the rapidly escalating cost of fiber that we experienced in the first


four months of the year began to stabilize. However, during this period, we experienced rapid


escalation in commodity cost with the greatest increases in energy, particularly natural gas, oil-


based materials and distribution cost.

As a result, margins were adversely affected. To offset these recent cost increases, we have


implemented content changes and price increases. The full effect of these changes should be seen


in the third quarter.


In the meantime, our team accomplished some new milestones and significant improvements


during the second quarter of 2008. We have another record quarter of production in our paper


manufacturing. Our converting plant, while in transitional phase, is poised for significant


improvement.


More specifically, in the paper manufacturing plant, we had a record paper making production in the


second quarter of 2008 of 14,250 tons, an 18.1% increase over the second quarter of last year, and


6.4% better than the first quarter of 2008.


In the converting department, we maintained our improvements of the first quarter while


implementing machine improvements, processes and programs for significant future improvements.


In our converted product shipments, we had shipments of approximately 1,507,000 pages, a 4.3%


improvement over the second quarter of 2007, and 1.1% over the last quarter.


In addition, we are third of the way through our converting automation project, which we discussed


during last quarter’s conference call. We expect to be halfway through by the first week of August


and have the project completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2008.


At the same time, we are rebuilding and upgrading a [inaudible] which will allow us to increase


productivity and efficiency. Also, we’re instituting a preventative maintenance program to improve


converting reliability and have embarked on an improved training program in the area.


In addition, we are accelerating a continuance improvement opportunities in our converting plant.


While we feel we are headed in the right direction, the recent inflationary cost increases in


wastepaper, power and another costs of production in a very competitive environment that have let


us to the conclusion that we need to expedite our efforts.


To this end, we are embarking upon us 20-week program with the support of an implementation


consulting group to accelerate our productivity improvement and cost reduction programs. This will


enable us to focus on our efforts on identified areas of improvement and put management systems


in place that will allow us to improve our productivity and reduce our costs.


Now, I will turn it over to Keith to discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Bob. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, we reported net income of 887,000 or


$0.14 per diluted share compared with net income of 743,000, or $0.12 per diluted share in the


same period of 2007. Net sales for the second quarter of 2008 is 22.3 million, an increase of 21%


over the 18.5 million net sales we reported for the same period in last year.


For the six month period ended June 30, 2008 our net income was 1.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted


share, compared with net income of 612,000, or $0.10 per diluted share in the 2007 period. Net


sales for the six month period of 2008 totaled 42.6 million, an increase 21% compared to the 35.2


million reported for the same period of 2007.


The increase in our net sales in the second quarter of 2008 was primarily due to the improved


pricing for converted products and increase shipments of parent rolls. Our net selling price per ton


of our converted products increased 14% in the current year quarter compared to the same period


last year.
