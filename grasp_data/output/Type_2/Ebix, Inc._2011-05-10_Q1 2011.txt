Robin will open today’s call with a few prepared remarks and then we’ll open things up to your


questions, because we want to address as many of you as possible, I do ask that you limit yourself


to a single question today.


With that let me turn the call over to Robin Raina.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Neil. Good morning gentlemen. I’m going to take this opportunity to discuss the results


on the financial and qualitative fronts, while giving you an insight into where Ebix would like to go


from a future vision’s perspective. On the financial front, we’re extremely pleased with the results.


Our press release today morning detailed these results, so I will concentrate on talking about just a


few financial metric.


Highlights of the quarter one – quarter were: One, total Q1 2011 revenue grew to a record $40.1


million, an increase of 27% as compared to Q1 2010 revenue of $31.6 million. The Q1 2011 results


include financial results from the A.D.A.M. acquisition for 53 days, $4.2 million in revenues


beginning 7th of February 2011. In a full quarter, Ebix would have received another 37 days of


revenue from A.D.A.M. Two, the exchange channel grew 36% year-over-year to $31.1 million or


78% of Q1 2011 revenues.


Reflecting the one-time acquisition related expenses of $1.8 million in the quarter, Ebix reported an


operating margin of 39% for Q1 2011, as compared to 40% for Q1 of 2010. This implies that our


operating margins would have been 43% in the quarter, if we were to exclude the non-recurring


expenses directly associated with A.D.A.M. acquisition, specifically, the $1.4 million investment


banking fee and $0.4 million of employee severance costs.


Based on the non-recurring trends, we can see that we are well on target to achieve the $0.15 or


more of accretion from the A.D.A.M. acquisition over a full year period. Operating cash flows


continued to be strong at $10.3 million in Q1 of 2011, in spite of non-recurring cash outflows of $4.1


million impacting it.


Like the early payment of an April payroll amounting to approximately $1.6 million, $1.4 million


associated with a one-time payment of investment banking fees for A.D.A.M. acquisition, $0.4


million of one-time severance charges for A.D.A.M., and approximately $0.7 million payments made


by the company after the closing for A.D.A.M.’s pre-acquisition period expenses.


The only convertible debt remaining as of 31st of March 2011 was for $5 million. Subsequent to the


close of Q1 2011, we retired this remaining $5 million in convertible debt for total consideration of


$6.8 million. The payment represents the convertible’s principal amount and a conversion gain of


$1.8 million related to the appreciation of Ebix’s common stock. We elected to redeem the


convertible debt using cash rather than common stock.


During Q1 2011, the company repurchased 106,483 shares of our common stock at an average


price of $22.49 per share for an aggregate amount of $2.4 million. Year to date, the company has


repurchased 377,573 shares of Ebix common stock in 2011, for an aggregate consideration in the


amount of $8.5 million, representing an average price of $22.5 per share.


If you were to add up the amounts used for purchase of stock from the market, and the amount


used to redeeming the convertible debt in cash rather than in stock, the company has basically paid


$14.3 million in 2011 till date, towards reducing dilutive share count in the market.


With $39.3 million of bank deposits, $35.6 million in cash and $3.7 million of fixed deposits for 90


days or more, as of March 31, 2011, $26.3 million of additional borrowing capacity as of April 19,
