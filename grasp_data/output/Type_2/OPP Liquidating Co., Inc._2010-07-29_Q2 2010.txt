Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Orchids Paper Products Company


Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Michele and I will be your operator for today. At this


time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session


[Operator Instructions]


On today’s call, we will be joined by Bob Snyder, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith


Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for


today, to Mr. Keith Schroeder. Please proceed.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Good morning and thank you, operator. Welcome to the Orchids Paper Products Company’s


second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. My name is Keith Schroeder and I am the Chief


Financial Officer. I’m pleased to be here today with Bob Snyder, our President and Chief Executive


Officer. This morning we will be discussing our financial results for the quarter.


The agenda for today’s call will be as follows. First, Bob will discuss our performance in the quarter


and discuss various initiatives being worked on within the company. I will then provide a discussion


of the results and some key financial metrics. Following that discussion, I will turn the call back over


to Bob for closing remarks. After Bob’s remarks, we’ll be happy to address any questions that you


might have.


And with that, I’d like to inform you that statements made during this conference call other than


those that refer to past events and results are forward-looking statements and are made pursuant


to the Safe Harbor provisions in the Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve risks


and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth during this


discussion.


Among other things, these risks and uncertainties include the risks and assumptions described in


Item 1A and Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. We operate in an


environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could


materially affect our operations. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking


statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.


With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Snyder.


Robert A. Snyder, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Keith. I am Bob Snyder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Orchids Paper Products.


It’s great to speak with you again. In the second quarter of 2010, we achieved record net sales of


over 24.7 million, up 2% from last year’s second quarter and earnings of $0.28 per diluted share.


During the second quarter of 2010, some major areas of interest were, in the paper manufacturing


plant, we had paper making production in the second quarter of 2010 of 13,766 tons, a 7% increase


over the same quarter last year. The parent roll market improved during the quarter and seems to


have stabilized.


In the converting plant, we’ve produced 1.5 million cases in the second quarter. Furthermore, we


had improved case shipments over our first quarter of 2010 by 14% and added shipments of 1.6


million cases in the second quarter. In addition, our open orders continue to strength in the early


stages of the third quarter.

Our new warehouse and our new converting line have been completed and turned over to


operations in July for an on-time and on-budget completion. The warehouse and new conversion


line projects are in line with our strategy to increase sales and profitability and to consume all of our


paper making production in the converting operation.


This has been a challenging quarter. I am encouraged by the efforts and team work of our Orchids


management and workforce.


Now, I’ll turn the call over to Keith to discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Bob. For the second quarter of 2010, our net income was $2.2 million or $0.28 per


diluted share compared with a net income of 3.8 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the same


period of 2009. This brings our 2010 year-to-date net income to $3.5 million or $0.46 per diluted


share compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.97 per diluted share for the same period in


2009. The earnings per share calculations for the respective 2010 periods reflect the effects of our


follow on offering of 862,500 shares in the third quarter of 2009.


Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were a record $24.7 million, an increase of 2% compared


to the $24.1 million in net sales we reported for the same period last year. Net sales of converted


products in the second quarter of 2010 were down about 10% to 20.2 million compared to 22.5


million in the prior year quarter which was a result of a 5% decrease in net selling prices which was


primarily due to a change in product mix and does not have a material effect on gross profit and a


5% decrease in the tonnage shipped.


Net sales of parent rolls in the current year quarter increased to $4.5 million compared to $1.6


million in the same period of 2009. The increase in parent roll sales was due to a 145% increase in


tonnage shipped and a 15% increase in net selling prices. The increase in parent roll tonnage


shipments was due to lower production requirements in our converting operation which resulted in


more tons being available to sell in parent roll form and a strengthened parent roll market. The


strengthened parent roll market allowed us to raise our selling prices during the quarter to begin to


offset the monthly waste paper price increase that begin in the latter half of last year.


EBITDA in the second quarter of 2010 was $4.4 million, which was a decrease of $2.2 million


compared to the $6.6 million we reported in the same quarter of 2009. As a percent of net sales,


EBITDA was 17.8% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 27.3% reported in the 2009 quarter.


Our gross profit for the second quarter of 2010 was $5.1 million, a decrease of 2.7 million or 35%


compared to the 2009 quarter. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased to 20.6% in the


current year quarter compared to 32.4% for the same period of 2009. The year-over-year reduction


in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due to several factors.


First, our cost of waste paper in the second quarter of 2010 was approximately 69% higher than the


cost experienced in the same period last year, thereby increasing our cost of sales by


approximately 2.1 million. The waste paper market was at lowest price point in 2009 during the


second quarter and prices began to increase starting in the third quarter last year.


Secondly, lower converted product shipment volumes resulted in lower production requirements on


our converting operation which resulted in a 21% increase on our per unit production cost. Also, the


lower production requirements on our converting operation resulted in a higher percentage of


parent roll production available to sell in parent roll form. While parent roll sales are profitable, they


generally carry a lower profit margin than converted product sales, so this mix shift was a negative
