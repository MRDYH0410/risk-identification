MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


[Starts Abruptly]


......Compared with 11.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Research and development


expenses increased to 2.7 million from 1.8 million in the 2009 fiscal second quarter.


Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to four million from 6.7 million in the same


quarter of the prior year. Operating income was 1.3 million, compared with 2.5 million in the fiscal


2009 second quarter. Net income was $55,000 or break-even on a per share basis compared with


1.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the prior year second quarter.


I’d like to take a moment to provide some detail on the state income tax issue Arthur mentioned


earlier. In fiscal 2010, second quarter, the company recorded a non-recurring, non-cash state


income tax charge due to a change in the apportionment factors in Pennsylvania tax law. The


impact of this change caused the company to decrease the value of its deferred tax assets,


resulting in a significant increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter.


For the quarter, we recorded income tax expense of $1.2 million for an effective tax rate of


approximately 95%. We expect our overall tax rate will be approximately 45% for the full year


ended June 30, 2010.


Turning now to the financial results for the first half of fiscal 2010, net sales increased to 60.2


million from 54.8 million for the comparable period of fiscal 2009. Gross profit was 19.6 million


compared with 20.0 million for the same period in the prior year. R&D expenses increased to 5.8


million from 3.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses decreased to 7.8 million from


11.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Net income grew to 2.9 million or $0.12 per diluted


share from 2.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the first half of the prior year.


Turning to the balance sheet, the company has more than 20 million in cash, cash equivalents, and


short-term investment securities available for sale and approximately $8 million of long-term debt


including the current portion.


With that brief financial overview, I will now turn the call back over to Arthur. Arthur?


Arthur P. Bedrosian, J.D., President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Keith. Several of you asked for an update on our plans regarding the company’s shelf


registration.


Let me start by saying, we believe the outlook for Lannett is bright. It is in that light that we continue


to evaluate a number of potential acquisition opportunities to enhance Lannett’s growth. We have


also held discussions with other generic firms to joint venture or contract manufacture certain


scheduled drugs using our expertise in that area.


While we are not currently a party to any binding agreements, the acquisition candidates include


products, technologies, and are small companies similar in size to ourselves. Any potential


acquisition must among other things be complementary to our businesses.


By securing the SEC approval for the shelf, we do not need to fear that an opportunity will pass us


by due to a lack of cash on hand or the ability to raise cash. At the same time, we are also


evaluating plans to expand and upgrade the capabilities and facilities of our pain management


business.

The pain management space is under-served and has excellent growth potential. We believe an


investment in our Cody Laboratories subsidiary would allow us to over time, garner a larger portion


of the market for pain management products. While we have a strong cash position, our board


authorized the filing of the shelf registration in order to fund an acquisition strategy, as well as other


expansion initiative.


Let me assure you that we will look at a number of factors before selling any stock, including the


price. Management and the board are significant shareholders in Lannett, making our interests very


much aligned with the company’s shareholders.


Moving on to pain management business, in mid-December we received FDA approval for


Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in two, four and eight milligram strength, products that have


relatively large market opportunity.


We continued marketing our Hydromorphone product and we expect to increase the manufacture


the active pharmaceutical ingredients for this product at our Cody facility in the fourth quarter of


fiscal 2010.


Last week, we announced that we expect to file a new drug application with the FDA for our


Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution. This is somewhat unusual situation for several reasons. We have


been manufacturing and marketing Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution for some time, and we’ll


continue to do so during the FDA’s review of our application. The FDA has indicated that it will


conduct its review on an expedited basis, which typically takes about six months.


Before opening the call to questions, I’d like to thank our customers, employees, and shareholders


for their continued support. With the time available, we would now like to address any questions


you may have. Operator?
