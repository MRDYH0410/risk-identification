highlighted by the continued execution of our well capitalized growth strategy. Despite a


challenging economic environment, Aegean further differentiated itself in both the industry and the


market by posting record sales volumes, net revenues and net income.

the company. Management’s notable accomplishments during 2008 combined with our recent


success entering into a new $300 million credit facility, have positioned Aegean well to drive future


performance in 2009 and beyond.


I will now begin my discussion for the fourth quarter and year-to-date on slide 6 of the presentation.


During the three months ended December 31, 2008, sales volume, a key driver of our business,


rose 52.8% from the year earlier period to 1,568,770 metric tons.


This considerable increase was primarily due to significant growth increase in Singapore as well as


strong contributions from our new markets located in Northern Europe, West Africa, the United


Kingdom and North America, which did not record any sales volume in Q4 2007.


For the full year 2008, sales volumes increased 51.3% to 5,200,256 metric tons compared to 2007.


While Spyros will provide more details regarding our financial results, I would like to note that our


strong sales volume led to an increase in net revenues to 51.6 million in Q4 2008, and $170.9


million for the full year 2008.


The gross spread on marine petroleum products also increased to $47.7 million for the fourth


quarter and 161 million for the full year 2008.


Operating income in the fourth quarter and full year 2008 improved to $18.3 million and $52.1


million respectively.


Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter, which includes a $1 million tax expense related to our


Canadian unit, was 14.1 million or 0.33 basic and diluted earnings per share. We are currently in


the process of restructuring our Canadian business and expect to decrease our income tax liability


in this jurisdiction going forward.


US GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2008 was $13.1 million or $0.31 basic and diluted


earnings per share which compared to net income of 6.3 million or $0.15 basic and diluted earnings


per share for Q4 2007.


For the full year 2008, we reported net income of $39.9 million or $0.94 basic and diluted earnings


per share. This compares to 27.7 or $0.65 basic and diluted earnings per share for 2007.


Our record results were directly related to the continued execution of management’s growth


strategy.


With this acquisition of ICS Petroleum, we entered new markets in Vancouver, Montréal and


Mexico during 2008. We also announced expansion plans in Tangiers, Morocco and Trinidad and


Tobago, increasing our global presence at 13 strategic markets worldwide.


Regarding our logistics infrastructure, we have taken delivery of seven double-hull bunkering tanker


newbuildings in 2008 and year-to-date 2009.


In further strengthening our ability to take advantage of the strong demand for modern tonnage, we


also acquired four double-hull bunkering tankers and two bunkering barges in the secondary


market during the same period.


We also implemented a $25 million stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter. This plan


which underscores our confidence in Aegean’s growth prospects, demonstrates our ongoing


commitment to create additional value for shareholders.
