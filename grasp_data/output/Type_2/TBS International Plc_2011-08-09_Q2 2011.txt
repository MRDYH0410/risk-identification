Good day and thank you for standing by, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the TBS International Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

We have with us today Joseph E. Royce, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mr. Fred Lepere, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the company. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session following the presentation. The conference will also be webcast live, audio and slideshow on the company's website at www.tbsship.com, by clicking on the webcast banner. I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 9, 2011.

We now pass the floor to one of your speakers for today, Mr. Fred Lepere. Please go ahead Mr. Lepere.

Well, good morning and thank you for joining TBS International's quarterly conference call. The purpose of today's call is to discuss the results of TBS' second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011.

On Monday, August 8, 2011, we issued a press release after the market closed in New York, with financial and operational information for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011. If you have not received this release, you may log on to our website at www.tbsship.com and navigate to the Investor Relations page or you can call Capital Link at area code 212-661-7566. We will also post the transcript of this call on our website once it has been prepared.

Our remarks today will be followed by a question-and-answer session. For those of you who want to follow our slide presentation, please go to the TBS website, which again is www.tbsship.com, and click on the webcast link. Note that the slides are user-controlled. For those of you who want to follow the webcast, please click on the arrow at the bottom of the webcast screen to make the slides turn. Also, please note that the webcast will be archived on our website.

Now, I'd like you to please turn to slide number two. This slide refers to forward-looking statements. During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements. Such statements are just predictions and involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially.

I'd like to refer you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.

And with that, I'd like to introduce Joseph Royce, our Chairman, CEO and President.

Thank you, Fred. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to TBS International's conference call for the results of the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011.

I'd like to begin our presentation with slide number three, the Baltic Indices. TBS's financial results for the second quarter and first six months of 2011 were negatively affected by three major macroeconomic factors: contingent deliveries of new built vessels in all dry bulk categories, which is increasing capacity as it outpaces scrapping of tonnage. Downward pressure on dry cargo freight rates and the high cost of transportation fuel, which we have not been able to pass on to our customers because of the downward pressure on freight rates.

Please now turn to slide number four, addressing weakness in dry cargo market. TBS is taking an aggressive proactive approach in gearing with the weaknesses in the dry cargo market.

We are engaged in cost reduction programs. Three key members from management purchased 100,000 Series A and Series B preference shares for aggregate consideration of $10 million. Pursuant to our rights offering, we issued 8260 Shares A Preference for an aggregate consideration of $826,000.

Please now turn to slide number five, looking into the third quarter 2011. So far in the third quarter of 2011, we see the same macroeconomic factors continuing. Deliveries of additional new built dry cargo vessels, continuing downward pressure on dry cargo freight rates with the Baltic Dry Index or BDI at 1,264 on August 8, 2011, compared to 1,348 on May 9, 2011.

Correspondingly, Baltic Handysize Index or BHSI was 657 on August 8, 2011, compared to 789 on May 9, 2011. And although the quoted price for a barrel of oil has come down in the past two weeks, the reduction in the prices of bunkers have been at a much slower rate, reflecting the continuous downturn in the BDI and lack of improvement in the TBS operating results.

We are in discussions with our lenders about our liquidity requirements. We have retained the services of Lazard Frères to assist TBS in this process and to address the liquidity requirements of the Company

Now, I'd like to turn the floor over to Fred Lepere, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Thank you, Joe. We should now all be on slide number six. This slide summarizes our second quarter 2011 operating and financial highlights. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, total revenues were $97.1 million, a decrease of 13% over the same period in 2010. Voyage revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2011 were $75.9 million, an increase of 8% from $70.6 million during the same period in 2010.

Time charter revenues for the second quarter 2011 decreased by 45% to $20.6 million from $37.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010. Our net loss for the second quarter 2011 was $14.4 million as compared to a net loss of $9.7 million over the same period in 2010. Earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis for the second quarter 2011 was a loss of $0.48 per share as compared to a loss of $0.32 per share for the second quarter of last year.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, was $13.4 million for the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of 40% over the same period in 2010. In May 2011, we took delivery of the M/V Maya Princess, the final delivery in the series of six 'Roymar Class' 34,000 deadweight-ton multipurpose tweendecker vessels and successfully concluded phase one of our newbuilding program, which we initiated in March 2007.

We currently have an operational fleet of 52 vessels, with an aggregate of 1.6 million deadweight-tons, consisting of 30 tweendeckers and 22 Handysize/Handymax bulk carriers.

During the second quarter of 2011, we continued our drydocking program and drydocked five vessels, including two vessels which entered into drydock during the first quarter of 2011, for a total of 783 days. Please now turn to slide – for a total of 83 days, sorry. Please now turn to slide number seven.

This slide demonstrates the revenue metrics for our business for the second quarter 2011. We begin with our Voyage business. During the second quarter of 2011, we operated 32 vessels in our freight voyage business and had 2,890 freight voyage days as compared to 28 vessels and 2,556 freight voyage days in the second quarter of 2010.

Our Daily Average Voyage Time Charter Equivalent was $11,156, a decrease of 23% compared to last year's second quarter. Overall, average freight rates for all cargos decreased 16% to $24.89 per ton as compared to last year's second quarter.

Average freight rates for non-aggregate cargos decreased 13% to $48.88 per ton for the second quarter of 2011 as compared to $56.46 per ton in 2010. As you can see on this slide, during the second quarter of 2011, we had a 28% increase in the total tons of cargo shipped, and a 19% increase in the tons of cargo shipped excluding aggregates.

We now turn to our time charter revenue metrics on the same slide. Our Average Daily Time Charter Equivalent for this business was $11,721 in the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of 37% from the $18,532 during the same period of 2010. Such decrease in time charter revenue was primarily due to lower average charter hire rates, which decreased 41% to $12,196 compared to last year's second quarter. We operated 19 vessels in this business for a total of 1,691 days as compared to 20 vessels for 1,838 days in the second quarter of 2010.

Slides eight and nine depict our operating and financial highlights as well as key metrics for the six months ended June 30, 2011. These slides are self-explanatory and the information is presented in more detail in our second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012 earnings press release we issued yesterday, as well as in our 10-Q for the period. I will answer any questions you may have during the question-and-answer session of this conference call.

Please now turn to slide number 10. This slide provides the highlights of our consolidated balance sheet. As of June 30, 2011, our net debt to capitalization ratio stood at 55%. During the first half of 2011, we made $10.9 million of scheduled debt principal payments and received proceeds of $10.8 million from separate offerings of Series A and B preference shares. Our cash balance at June 30, 2011 was $13.1 million.

In connection with our recently concluded newbuilding program, during the first half of 2011, we paid $6.2 million from our restricted cash to the shipyard. As at June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all amended financial covenants relating to our bank debt. During the second quarter, we modified these agreements to reduce the minimum consolidated interest charge coverage ratio for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 and for the quarters ending through December 31, 2011 from 3.35 to 1 to 2.50 to 1.

In addition, the modifications increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for the same periods from 4 to 1 to 5.10 to 1 and reduced minimum cash requirement from $15 million to $10 million. Beginning in 2012, the financial covenant requirements revert back to the levels set in our January 2011 credit agreement amendments.

TBS will need to raise additional funds to facilitate principal repayments due September 30, 2011, and to remain in compliance with the minimum cash liquidity covenant. Absent the ability to raise additional capital and a significant near-term improvement in freight and charter rates, we will need to enter into further modifications or waivers to the financial covenants. Our inability to meet any of the covenants or to obtain waivers of such future covenant violations continues to raise substantial doubt about TBS's ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, in compliance with U.S. GAAP, we have classified the entire amount of debt outstanding as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2011.

We've now reached the end of our presentation. The slides in the appendix provide our EBITDA reconciliation and additional information on our business model, trade routes, fleet and our global network. Please take a look at them at your convenience.

We thank you for your interest in and support of our company. And I would like to open the conference call to questions from our investors. Operator, please open the floor for questions.

[Operator Instruction] And we have a question from the line of John Shortino with Superior Technology. Please proceed.

In your opinion, with the dropping oil crude prices, how long will that take to make an impact on your everyday operations?

Well, that's a hard question to answer because as you can appreciate, the market is still in flux. But we have always felt that somewhere around 30, somewhere in the next 30 days that we'll start to see the impact at our pumps in the different places around the world.

And ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions in the queue, I will just transfer the call back to Mr. Royce for closing remarks.

Thank you very much. And again, I would like to thank you for your interest and support and look forward to our next conference call for the third quarter 2010 results. And I'd like to wish everybody a nice day.

Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. And you may now disconnect. Have a great day.
