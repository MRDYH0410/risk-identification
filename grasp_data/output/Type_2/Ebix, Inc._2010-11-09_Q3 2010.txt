statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or

to a single question today.


Now let me turn you over to Robin Raina.

A comparison of the third quarter 2010 numbers to the third quarter 2009 numbers reveals that all


four areas, namely revenue, income, EBITDA, and diluted EPS grew in this quarter as compared to


third quarter of 2009. Revenues in the third quarter of 2010 were 33.3 million as compared to 23.3


million in the third quarter of 2009, a 43% increase. Nine months cumulative revenues at the end of


September 2010 increased by 46% to $97.1 million as compared to $66.4 million in the same


period a year ago.


Our Exchange business grew 66% year-over-year to become 71% of our total revenue this quarter.


Net income after taxes in the third quarter of 2010 was 16.7 million as compared to $9.4 million in


the third quarter of 2009, a 77% increase. EBITDA for the current quarter was $19.1 million, a 57%


EBITDA margin, which is a 75% improvement over the 10.9 million EBITDA, a 46% EBITDA margin


in the third quarter of 2009.


The company’s operating expenses for the quarter grew by 50% to $20.2 million as compared to


$13.5 million for the third quarter of 2009. Results for the third quarter of 2010 were based on 39


million weighted average diluted shares outstanding as compared to 37.8 million in the third quarter


of 2009.


Diluted EPS in the third quarter of 2010 rose 77% to $0.43 as compared to $0.25 in the third


quarter of 2009. Our net margins after taxes grew to 50% in the third quarter of 2010 as compared


to 41% in the third quarter of 2009, primarily because of the non-cash operating income of $3.9


million associated with the decrease in the fair value of the put option issued to former shareholder


E-Z Data.


Ebix business is broken into four channels: Carrier channel, Exchanges, Broker channel and the


BPO channel. To look at the performance of these channels, I have a few numbers for you.


Exchanges this quarter was 71% of our revenues, BPO 12%, Broker Systems 10%, and Carrier


Systems 7%. Exchanges, Broker and BPO channel grew this quarter in comparison to third quarter


of 2009 while the Carrier Systems sales continued to be affected by delayed decisions, tight


budgets and implications of the major downturn in property and casualty insurance industry.


The Exchange channel grew 66% year-over-year to 23.5 million or 71% of the third quarter


revenues. The BPO channel grew 13% year-over-year to 4.1 million or 12% of third quarter


revenues. The Broker channel grew 18% year-over-year to 3.5 million or 10% of third quarter


revenues. The Carrier channel dropped 14% year-over-year to 2.2 million or 7% of third quarter


revenues.


Let me run through a few balance sheet metrics now. One, cash flows. As regards of cash flows,


we continue to generate strong cash flows that are bound to continue to grow even more with the


recent acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the company generated


$33.8 million of net cash flow from ongoing operations as compared to 22.1 million for the same


nine-month period in 2009. This represents a 93% realization of our cash-based net income as


defined in our press release for the nine-month period.


So how have we continued to use our cash flows? Let us look at our performance on that front.


Overall debt, the company’s overall debt, both long and short-term is down to $42.5 million as of


30th of September 2010 as compared to $63.7 million as of 30th of September 2009. This is in


spite of the fact that since 30th of September 2009, the company has spent $48.41 million in cash


for making acquisitions and additional $10.65 million for share repurchases and an additional $2.8


million for making on our payments.


Use of cash flow for acquisitions, we spent 14.88 million of cash was invested in acquisitions of


MCN, Trade Monitor, Connective, E-Trek and USIX. Use of cash flows for reducing convertible


debt, 12.02 million was remitted during the third quarter with respect to the settlement of conversion


elections made by White box in regards to their August ‘09 convertible promissory note.
