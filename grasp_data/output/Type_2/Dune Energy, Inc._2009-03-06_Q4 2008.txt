MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Dune Energy Fourth Quarter Full Year Operating


and Financial Results presentation on the 6 March, 2009. Throughout today’s presentation, all


participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask


questions. [Operator Instructions].


I will now hand the conference over to James Watt. Please go ahead, sir.


James A. Watt, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to Dune Energy’s 2008 year-end conference


call to discuss operating and financial results of 2008 and plans for 2009 and beyond.


I’m James Watt, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. With me today is, Alan


Gaines, Chairman of the Board; Frank Smith, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Craig, Senior Vice


President of Investor Relations.


Before we begin, let me caution everyone about forward-looking statements, which will be included


in this presentation. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements


concerning estimates of expected drilling and development wells and associated costs, statements


relating to estimates of, and increases in, production, cash flows and values, statements relating to


the continued advancement of Dune Energy’s projects and other statements which are not


historical facts. When used in this conversation, the words such as, “could,” “plan,” “estimate,”


“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “potential,” “should,” and similar expressions are all forward-looking


statements.


Although Dune Energy believes that its expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements


are reasonable, such statements involve risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given


that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements. Important factors that


could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements include the potential that


the Company’s projects will experience technological and mechanical problems, geological


conditions in the reservoir may not result in commercial levels of oil and gas production, changes in


product prices and other risks disclosed in Dune’s Annual Report and on Form 10-K filed with the


U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


After the market closed yesterday, we published our 10-K for 2008 and provide the press release


highlighting critical items from the 10-K. This morning I will further highlight selected items from that


release, but the primary focus of today’s call will be future operations and financial position of the


Company.


Revenue for 2008 was a 147 million as compared with 71 million for 2007. Production volumes in


2008 were 11.4 Bcfe as compared with 7.1 Bcfe in 2007. The average sales price for oil in 2008


was 99.87 per barrel and the average for natural gas was $9.62 per 1000 cubic feet. However,


prices dropped dramatically in the fourth quarter to 55.87 per barrel for oil and 6.96 per Mcf for


natural gas and it had further declines going into the first quarter.


Direct lease level operating expense was 6.6 million in the fourth quarter and 24.8 million for the


year or $2.18 per Mcfe produced. Workover expenses of 5.5 million or $0.48 per Mcfe produced ad


valorem and production taxes of 12 million or a $1.05 per Mcfe produced in transportation of 1.3


million or $0.11 per Mcfe produced.


Total lease operating expenses for 2008 was 43.5 million or $3.82 per Mcfe produced. Average


price received per Mcfe in 2008 was $12.90. For the year, total G&A expense was 18.5 million

which included 5.3 million of stock-based compensation as compared to 2007 total G&A of 22.2


million including 8.1 million of stock-based compensation.


Cash G&A in 2008 was 13.2 million versus 14.1 million in 2007. This reduction in cash G&A reflects


a reduction in total personnel to 52 employees from 60 a year earlier. DD&A was 56.7 million for


2008 and interest was an additional 35 million for the year. We recorded a $125.7 million pre-tax to


non-cash impairment charge associated with our oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter of


2009. This charge was related to the dramatically lower commodity prices at year-end 2008 versus


the same levels in 2007. Company’s bank covenants were not impacted by this change.


The net loss for 2008 including the write-down associated with the asset impairment was 141.1


million. Net loss available to common shareholders was 241.7 million reflecting 100.6 million of


non-cash preferred dividends. This dividend included the quarterly dividends paid in a payment in


kind along with a $68.4 million dividend to the preferred associated with the change in the


conversion price of the preferred stock from $3 per share to $1.75 per share. This dividend was


recorded in the second quarter of 2008. There are no additional resources associated with the


preferred shares.


Capital expended during 2008 was 52.8 million, broken down into 33.8 million for drilling and


completion costs, 8.8 million for facilities and leasehold improvements to enhance the producing


capabilities of our field, and 10.1 million for capital workovers. Of the 33.8 million for drilling and


completion costs in 2008, approximately 9.5 million was associated with completing operations


commenced in 2007.


Year-end reserves as prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton were 8.2 million barrels of oil and


83.8 billion cubic feet of gas or 133 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent. This compares with 175.3


billion cubic feet of gas equivalent at year-end 2007.


During 2008, we sold 32.1 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent in our Barnett Shale properties,


produced 12.8 billion cubic feet, including 1.4 billion from the Barnett prior to its sale. We added


13.5 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent through extensions and drilling and recorded a negative


revision of previous estimates of 11 Bcfe.


2008 was a year of significant challenges, mostly driven by the collapse of the commodity prices in


the fourth quarter and the overall negative market conditions. My focus now is on how to move the


company forward and capture the upside value associated with many of our properties for all our


stakeholders.


Let me first review overall liquidity and the structure of our various debt instruments. We ended


2008 with approximately 15.5 million in cash and no borrowings drawn against our $40 million


revolver. We are currently in discussions with our bank and anticipate the availability going forward


on the revolver will be between 35 and 50 million, based on the year-end reserve report.


The 300 million of senior secured notes have a maturity of June 1, 2012. The 10.5% interest


payment is due on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The current 227.6 million of convertible


preferred have a maturity beyond that of the notes. Dividends of 12% are payable quarterly in cash


or a payment in kind or PIK at the company’s choice. If preferred shares are converted prior to June


2010, there is a make whole provision payable in cash or common stock at current value with a


slight discount at the company’s choice. The revolver has a majority – has a maturity of May of


2010 unless extended.


As long as we do not take on debt beyond the maximum allowed of $50 million, the primary


restrictive covenant in place on the debt instruments is that we maintain at least 10 million of cash


or availability under our revolver at the end of each quarter. Thus near term, we do not face either


maturity issues or covenant issues associated with our various debt instruments.
