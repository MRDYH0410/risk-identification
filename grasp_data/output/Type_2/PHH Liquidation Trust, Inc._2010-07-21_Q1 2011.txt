MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to the Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2011


Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and


introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Larry


Keener. Please go ahead, sir.


Larry Keener, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Cindy and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Joining me here are


Kelly Tacke, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President; and Greg Aplin, President of


CountryPlace Mortgage.


Before we begin, our attorneys have reminded me to remind you that all comments made today are


made within the context of the Safe Harbor Rules, that past performance is no guarantee of future


results and that any comments about improving performance may not incur. Now onto the specifics


of the quarter.


As we stated on our last call in May, we expected improved results in the first quarter due to our


fourth quarter restructuring and the improving business environment. Revenues for the quarter


were up 1.9 million, or 2.3%, at 84.3 million versus 82.4 million prior year. The revenue increase


was generated despite operating 25 fewer retail locations and one less factory than last year. The


revenue increases were driven by a 25.8% increase in homes delivered, offset by an 18.6% decline


in average selling prices.


Selling prices declined due to three factors: (1) market preference for smaller, less-expensive


homes; (2) depressed home appraisals; and (3) a large increase in single-wide HUD unit sales.


Gross profit for the quarter was 22% versus 23.4% prior year; a decline of a 140 basis points.


Gross profit decline was driven by an early quarter spike in raw material cost and by customer


preferences for lower priced homes, which have slightly lower margins. SG&A expense declined


3.8 million to 20.5 million versus 24.4 million prior year, a 15.7% reduction. SG&A reductions were


generated by the reduced operating footprint of the company resulting from our fourth quarter


downsizing and restructuring. In addition to the reduction in retail locations and factories, we have


also significantly reduced corporate overhead and staffing. Net loss for the quarter was reduced by


42.6%; loss for the quarter was 5.7 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to 10 million prior year, or


$0.44 per share.


EBITDA for the quarter improved significantly, going from a negative 3.4 million last year to a slight


negative of $337,000 this year. Without the impact of the spike in raw material cost, company would


have been EBITDA positive for the quarter. I will now turn the call over to Kelly to discuss the


balance sheets and other specifics about the quarter.


Kelly Tacke, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary


Thanks Larry. Well in light of the current overall economic conditions, our top priorities remain cash


preservation and cash generation in every area of our business. To that end, I remind you that last


quarter we reached an agreement with Textron to amend the terms of our floor plan facility and


extend the expiration date until April 2011, and in certain circumstances further extend through


June 2012.

The agreement also provides for a gradual step down of the total committed amount to 25 million


by March 2011, favorably adjusts certain financial covenants, and allows for an increased


percentage of eligible inventory to be borrowed at the lender’s discretion.


At the end of the quarter, our floor plan payable to Textron totaled 35.9 million, a decrease of 8.5


million since January. Also last quarter, we, through CountryPlace, obtained a 20 million 4-year


term loan from Virgo. The loan is secured by the assets of CountryPlace Mortgage. This quarter,


we sold 917 homes, an increase of a 143 homes, or 18%, over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.


While this is very good news, it does put pressure on cash.


At the end of the quarter, cash totaled 16.9 million, a decrease of 9.8 million since the beginning of


the fiscal year. Trade receivables increased 2.3 million this quarter, reflecting the improving


business conditions. We continue to manage our inventories down. Total inventories declined 4.3


million since the beginning of the fiscal year. Accounts receivable and new home inventory for


company-owned retail and builder location was approximately 1.1 million, a slight decrease since


the beginning of the fiscal year.


Consumer loans receivable totaled 173.8 million, a decline of 2.4 million since the beginning of the


fiscal year which is due solely to customer payment. CountryPlace is currently servicing


approximately 2800 loans with an average FICO score of 709, an average down payment of over


16%, and an average balance of approximately 61,700.


Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased approximately 1.7 million compared to the


beginning of the fiscal year. This reflects an increase in accounts payable of 4.1 million, offset by


decrease in accrued liabilities of 2.4 million. The increase in payables reflects the increase in


homes sold. The decrease in accrued liabilities reflects decline in compensation-related accruals,


deferred revenue, and customer deposits, offset by increases in accruals related to homes sold.


The convertible debt bears interest at 3.75% and is due in May 2024. However, the debenture


holders may require us to repurchase the debt on certain date, the earliest of which is May 15,


2011.


In summary, we continue to carefully manage our liquidity to handle the improving business


conditions while reducing our floor plan payable to Textron. Larry?


Larry Keener, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks Kelly. The company ended the quarter with 56 operating retail locations, compared to 81


prior year. Unit sales through company stores increased 24.5%, from 580 to 722 homes. Same-


store sales increased 39.4% in units and 15.4% in dollars. Company-store homes sold increased


for the third consecutive quarter.


Unit sales to independent distribution also improved from 149 last year to a 195 this year, an


increase of 30.9%. This is noteworthy in that the company does not offer wholesale floor plan


financing to independent distribution as do many competing companies and brands. HUD homes


sold increased 30.2% from 556 to 724. Multi-wide HUD homes sold increased 10.9%, while single-


wide homes increased in more significant 91%. The company’s single-wide success represents a


market-driven response to the customer preferences in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, New


Mexico, and Louisiana.


Modular residential sales continued increasing for the third consecutive quarter and were up from a


173 homes prior year to a 193 homes this year, an increase of 11.6%. The company shipped 11


commercial modular units in the quarter worth $726,000. We count only commercial structures in
