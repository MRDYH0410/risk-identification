MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Amy and I will be your conference operator today. At this


time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2009 First Quarter Investors’ Conference Call.


[Operator Instructions]


Thank you. Mr. Raina, you may begin your conference.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for attending Ebix 2009 Q1 investor conference


call. I have also here with me, Ebix CFO, Robert Kerris. Our Q1 2009 results were announced a


few hours back. Let me summarize those results for you. Q1 2009 results were yet again record


results, the best ever in Ebix’s history in terms of diluted EPS, net income and revenues. Each of


the last many quarters has been a record result with each quarter beating all the preceding quarters


in our 33-year history of the company.


As a management team, we have believed in being consistent rather than just producing


spectacular quarters. You could compare these results to Q1 of 2008 or Q4 of 2008 or for that


matter compare it to Q1 of 2007 and all comparisons will show that the present quarter scored over


all these quarters on all four key criteria: growth in revenues, net income, diluted EPS, and net


margins.


Let us delve a bit deeper into it. A comparison of the Q1 2009 numbers to the Q1 2008 numbers


reveals that all four – namely revenue, income, net margin, and diluted EPS – grew in this quarter


as compared to Q1 of 2008. Revenue in the first quarter of ‘09 was 24% higher than the first


quarter of 2008. Net income after taxes in the first quarter of 2009 was 8.3 million as compared to


5.7 million in the first quarter of 2008, a 47% increase.


The company’s operating expenses for the quarter grew by 17% to 12.31 million as compared to


10.5 million for the first quarter of 2008. Results for the first quarter of 2009 were based on 12.36


million weighted average diluted shares outstanding as compared to 12.46 in the first quarter of


2008. Basic earnings per share in the first quarter of ‘09 rose 51% to $0.84 as compared to $0.55 in


the first quarter of 2008.


I am especially pleased that our net margins grew to 40% in the first quarter of 2009 as compared


to 34% in the first quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, we generated 7.8 million of net


cash flow from operations, which represents 116% or a $4.2 million improvement over the first


quarter of 2008.


EBITDA for the current quarter was 9.5 million, implying 46% of our revenues, a significant


improvement over the 7 million EBITDA from first quarter of ‘08 that was 42% of our revenues at


that time.


The current economic environment has made things harder for any company and we are no


exception to that. The insurance industry worldwide has been hit severely by the present economic


crisis, and new capital expense decisions are either being delayed or just being put into cold


storage. To add to that, the U.S. dollar has strengthened by approximately 30% in the first quarter


of ‘09 as compared to the first quarter of ‘08, having an obvious adverse impact on our revenues


and net income numbers.


Considering all that, this has been a satisfying quarter to the extent that it helps underline the


fundamental strength of the company today. Our repetitive revenue streams and infrastructure-

based transaction services help ensure that Ebix continues to grow its revenues, net income, and


net margins steadily.


A comparison of the first quarter 2009 numbers to the fourth quarter 2008 numbers reveals that all


four – namely revenue, income, net margin, and diluted EPS – grew in this quarter as compared to


the fourth quarter of 2008. Our revenues grew almost 3% as compared to the fourth quarter of


2008; our net income after taxes grew 5%; our diluted EPS grew 5%; and our net margins grew


almost by 1%.


The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has been rather dramatic since last year. A comparison


between Q1 2008 and Q1 2009 reveals that the Australian dollar has devalued by 27%, New


Zealand dollar has devalued by 31%, and Singapore dollar by 7%.


Even compared to fourth quarter of 2008, the first quarter of 2009 had to deal with the effect of


comparative devaluation of these currencies, with the Australian dollar having devalued by 1%,


New Zealand dollar having devalued by 6%, Singapore dollar having devalued by 2%. This is since


changing in – since March 31, the dollar has gone in the right way, which means it’s – the currency


devaluation – the foreign currency devaluation has started to improve.


For those of you who like to look at currency-neutral results, I have some numbers for you.


Currency adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2009 grew to 22.4 million, a 34% increase over


the first quarter of 2008. Currency-adjusted net income after taxes in the first quarter of ‘09 grew to


8.91 million, a 56% increase over the first quarter of 2008. Basically, what it means is that if you


were to keep currency rates constant between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009,


Ebix revenues would have been 1.73 million higher and net income would have been $580,000


higher. Currency-adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use solely for comparing


numbers from two different periods without the impact of foreign exchange.


Over the last six months, lots of new institutions and investors have discovered the Ebix story. For


their benefit, I felt it would be useful for me to emphasize the consistency of the Ebix story by


looking back and comparing the Q1 2009 results to Q1 2007 also, to emphasize the strides the


company has continued to make in a consistent manner.


Our revenues for the first quarter of 2009 grew by 129% as compared to the first quarter of 2007.


Our net income after taxes grew by 325% as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Net margins


grew from 21% to almost – 22% to 40%. Our diluted EPS grew 13% between these two quarters,


showing that our Q1 2009 numbers were better than the Q1 2007 numbers on all four criteria:


revenue, income, net margins, and diluted EPS.


Ebix’s business is broken into four channels: carrier channel, exchanges, broker channel, and the


BPO channel. To look at the performance of these channels, I have a few numbers for you.


Exchanges this quarter were 58% of our revenues; BPO, 17%; carrier systems, 14%; and broker


systems, 11%.


Exchanges, carrier systems and BPO, all three grew this quarter in comparison to the first quarter


of 2008 or as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The broker channel in local currency terms


grew this quarter in comparison to first quarter 2008 or the fourth quarter of 2008. The broker


channel, however, in U.S. dollar terms, the first quarter 2009 had slightly lower numbers. In fact, the


broker system channel had 18% lower numbers as compared to the first quarter of 2008. And the


prime reason for that is – and that’s a kind of a misleading picture. The broker channel was mostly


impacted by the currency fluctuations. In local currency terms, as I’ve said, the numbers were


better. However, our broker channel primarily comprises a broker system business coming out from


international.
