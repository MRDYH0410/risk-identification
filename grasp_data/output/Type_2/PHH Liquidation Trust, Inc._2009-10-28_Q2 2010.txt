MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day and welcome to this Palm Harbor Homes Incorporated Second Quarter


Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and


introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Larry


Keener. Please go ahead, sir.


Larry Keener, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, [inaudible] and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I have with me


on our end of the call Kelly Tacke, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;


[inaudible], President of CountryPlace Mortgage, and [inaudible], Executive Vice President of


CountryPlace Mortgage.


Before we begin today, our attorneys have required me to remind you that all comments made


today are made within the context of Safe Harbor rules, that past performance is no guarantee of


future results and that any comments about improving performance may not occur.


Now, on to the specifics of the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was 74.8 million compared to 110.7


million prior year, a decrease of 32.4%. The decline in revenue for the quarter resulted from a


32.8% drop in homes sold and a 3.9% decline in average selling prices for factory-built homes.


Year-to-date, revenue was 157.2 million compared to 240.7 million prior year, a decline of 34.7%.


The decline in year-to-date revenue resulted from a 35.9% drop in homes sold and a 1.6% decline


in average selling prices for factory-built homes.


The decreases in average selling prices for both the quarter and year-to-date are due to customers


moving down market and buying smaller, less expensive homes. Additionally, appraisal values for


home sales financed have declined significantly, due to foreclosure and short-sale values being


used as appraisal comparables.


On a positive note, the 35.9% decline in homes sold year-to-date compares favorably with the


43.2% decline in HUD-code homes shipped year-to-date and the 50.4% decline in modular homes


shipped year-to-date. Despite the decline in revenues and average selling prices, margins for the


quarter remain solid at 24.1% flat with last year. Year-to-date, margins are 23.7% down modestly


from 24.3% prior year.


Operating efficiencies improved in all nine of our operating factories. These improvements, in


addition to consistent strong operating margins from our finance and insurance operations


accounted for the company’s margin performance. SG&A expense was 24.7 million for the quarter,


a decline of $6.4 million or 20.7%. Year-to-date, SG&A expense was $49.0 million compared to


62.3 million prior year, a decrease of $13.2 million or 21.3%.


The company is operating two fewer factories and nine fewer retail locations than this time last


year. Additionally, overall company head count is down 26.6%. Loss for the quarter was $10.4


million or $0.45 a share, compared to 7.8 million prior year or $0.34 a share. Year-to-date, the loss


is 20.4 million or $0.89 a share, compared to 8.4 million or $0.37 per share prior year. Prior year


included a 3.8 million or $0.17 a share gain from the repurchase of 14.4 million of the company’s


convertible debt at a discount.


For the quarter, the loss from operations was only 6.6 million compared to 4.4 billion prior year. I


say, only, because the revenue drop for the quarter was $35.9 million. The $2.2 million difference in


operating income is only a small fraction of lost income, the 32% drop in revenue would normally


produce. However improved operating efficiencies and large SG&A reductions, narrowed the


operating loss significantly.

Perhaps more importantly, the reductions in SG&A expense and improvements in operating cost


mentioned earlier, coupled with significant reductions in working capital required, produced positive


operating cash flow through the first six months of $13 million.


I will now turn the call over to Kelly Tacke, who will have more specifics on this point and other key


information.


Kelly Tacke, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary


Thanks, Larry. The financial story this quarter continues to be one about cash management. In light


of the current economic conditions and with no near-term signs of a quick recovery for the factory-


built housing industry, our top priorities remain cash generation and cash preservation in every area


of our business.


Cash totaled 17.3 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of five million, since the beginning of


the fiscal year. For the first six months of fiscal 2010, net cash provided by operating activities


totaled 13 million. We continue to manage our inventories down. Total inventories declined 11.2


million or 12%, since the beginning of the fiscal year.


Accounts receivable and new home inventory for company-owned retail and builder location was


approximately 1.2 million, a decrease of 20% compared to the second quarter of last year.


Consumer loans receivable totaled 184.2 million, a decline of 7.4 million, since the beginning of the


fiscal year, which is due solely to customer payments. CountryPlace is currently servicing


approximately 3,200 loans, with an average FICO score of 709, average down payment of over


16% and an average balance of approximately 63,200.


Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased approximately 4.3 million compared to the


beginning of the fiscal year, due solely to the timing of the quarter-end, as compared with our


monthly check run. The convertible debt bears interest at 3.25% and is due May 2024. However,


the debenture holders may require us to repurchase the debt on certain dates, the earliest is May


15, 2011.


Our floor plan agreement is with Textron, who announced during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 that


they are in the process of an orderly liquidation of their housing inventory finance business. In June


of 2009, we amended our agreement with Textron and extended the expiration date to June 30,


2010 and lowered the committed amount from 50 million to 45 million and further lowered it to 40


million by December 31, 2009. We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants, as of the


end of the second quarter.


While no guarantees can be made in this regard, especially in light of the overall economic


condition, we do expect to replace Textron before the facility expires. This quarter, our interest


expense included a non-cash charge of 589,000 for the adoption of new accounting rules, which


relates to the accounting for convertible debt instruments that maybe be settled in cash upon


conversion.


The non-cash interest expense included in the second quarter of last year was 676,000. These


accounting rules require that the liability and equity component of our convertible debt is separately


accounted for in a way that reflects a non-convertible debt interest rate. This means that the equity


component is reflected, as an increase to additional paid-in capital and the debt is reduced by an


equal amount.


The reduction in debt is treated as a debt discount, which will increase interest expense and


accrete the debt to its face value over time. At the end of the day, the adoption of this new
