MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Mae, and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time


I would like to welcome everyone to the Ebix Second Quarter 2008 Investor call. All lines have


been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a


question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]


Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Robin Raina, President and CEO of Ebix. Sir,


you may begin.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for attending Ebix 2008 Second Quarter Investor


Conference call. I have also here with me Ebix CFO, Robert Kerris. The last few days have seen a


few important announcements from Ebix: yesterday the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based


Acclamation Inc.; and today the second quarter 2008 financial results followed by the three-for-one


stock split announcement. In today’s investor call my intent would be to cover all these


announcements from the company.


Let us start with the financial results. Our Q2 2008 results were announced yesterday. Let me


summarize those results for you from our perspective. Q2 results were yet again record results, the


best ever in Ebix’s 32 years young history in terms of diluted EPS. To look at these results and


compare them to the same quarter last year or to the first quarter of 2008 would reveal to you that


the company has shown consistent growth over this period. Each of the last many quarters has


been a record result with each quarter beating all the preceding quarters in our 32-year history as a


company, this being our 10th quarter of sequential growth in terms of net income or EPS.


Q2 results were pleasing to us since there was nothing spectacular that accounted for these


results. No large one-time deals were booked in this quarter that accounted for this growth. It was


simply normal organic growth with each of our divisions contributing to the increased revenue in the


quarter.


In the Ebix model of keeping a tight control on costs increased revenue is likely to result in


increased margins as is evident in this quarter. Revenues grew consistently in Q2 2008 if you were


to compare it to Q1 2008 or Q2 2007. Revenues grew to 17.8 million in Q2 2008 from 9.82 million


in Q2 2007, an 81% growth. Or if you were to compare it to Q1 of 2008 revenues grew 7%. As


revenues grew, net margins in second quarter of 2008 grew to 36% from 34% in the first quarter of


2008 and 26% in the second quarter of 2007.


Net income after taxes for the quarter rose 152% to 6.34 million or $1.62 per diluted share, up from


2.51 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the second quarter of ‘07 and earnings per share growth


of 116%. Net income after taxes for the quarter, if we were to compare it to the first quarter of 2008,


the net income after taxes for the quarter rose 12% to 6.34 million, up from 5.67 million; basically


an earnings per share growth of 16%.


Results for the second quarter of ‘08 were based on 3.99 million weighted average diluted shares


outstanding as compared to 3.37 million in the second quarter of ‘07 or 4.15 million in the first


quarter of ‘08. The company also reported basic earnings per share in the second quarter of ‘08 of


$1.96 as compared to $0.85 in the second quarter of ‘07 and $1.66 in the first quarter of ‘08.


The company also reported that a cumulative net income at the end of six months of ‘08 grew by


168% to 12 million as compared to cumulative net income of 4.48 million at the end of six months of


‘07. The six months cumulative diluted EPS for ‘08 also grew by 121% to $3.01 as compared to


cumulative diluted EPS of $1.36 at the end of six months of ‘07.

To put the company’s 2008 six month performance in perspective, you could compare the six-


month performance of the company in ‘08 to the 12-month performance of the company in ‘07. That


is, compare six-month income or EPS numbers in ‘08 to the 12-month income or EPS numbers in


‘07.


In 2007, the company’s net income for the full year was $12.67 million as compared to the net


income number of 12 million for the first six months of ‘08. Similarly, in 2007 the company’s EPS for


the full year was $3.61, as compared to company’s EPS of $3.01 for the first six months of 2008.


So why are second quarter 2008 results better than first quarter 2008 results? I would like to say


the quarter was rather uneventful with nothing real noteworthy in terms of any special large deals


that caused these improved results. The only noteworthy reason is that as in the case of all our


acquisitions we keep improving the economics each quarter as we grow revenues and we keep


integrating the businesses.


Our business is continuing to evolve and strengthen with each quarter. The company business can


be broken primarily into four main channels today; the insurance company, the broker channel, the


exchange channel, and the BPO [Business Process Outsourcing] channel. The second quarter for


the exchange channel become 53% of our total revenues, while the BPO channel accounted for


10% of our revenues.


Broker system business accounted for 19%, and the carrier channel accounted for 16% of our


worldwide revenues. All these four channels showed growth this quarter in terms of revenues as


compared to Q2 of ‘07. The legacy support business as predicted earlier continues to decline, and


accounted for 2% of our revenues in the second quarter of 2008.


Our exchange business continues to evolve. We conduct almost 36 billion in annuity premiums


annually now on our annuity exchange. We conduct in excess of 12 million transactions annually on


our life exchange. We conduct in excess of 80% of property and casualty e-commerce transactions


in Australia now. We’re deploying an exchange for property and casualty in New Zealand at


present, et cetera. We need to evolve the EbixExchange name worldwide and deploy such


exchanges in Europe, Asia, Africa, and increase our range of services in the United States related


to the exchange sector.


Let me now talk about the announcement we made yesterday as regards the acquisition of


Acclamation, Inc. Thinking about acquisitions, I’m reminded of what Warren Buffett reportedly once


said. And again I’m going to quote Warren Buffett here. To quote him, “We simply attempt to be


fearful when others are greedy, and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”


As a pragmatic management team, we are strong believers in this quote. We see the present hard


economic times as an opportunity to make complementary accretive acquisitions at realistic prices


that we can afford. Towards that extent, we have kept looking for the right mix of acquisitions that


provide us entry into hard to enter regions or markets that we think are going to be lucrative for Ebix


in the short and long term both.


Yesterday, we announced the successful acquisition of Pittsburgh based Acclamation, Inc.,


marking our entry into the health benefits and claims processing industry. Acclamation has been a


leading provider of software-as-a- service based healthcare benefits and claims management


software in the US. Since its inception in 1989, Acclamation has focused itself on providing benefit


administration systems to some of the world’s largest insurance carriers, third-party administrators,


and self-administered organizations. Today, Acclamation is seen as a leading player in the health


benefits software industry, providing benefit services to an estimated 7 million insured lives through


its customer base of approximately 80 clients encompassing health insurance companies, third-


party administrators, et cetera.
