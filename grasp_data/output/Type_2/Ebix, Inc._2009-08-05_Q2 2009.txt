MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Ashley , and I will be your conference operator today. At this


time I would like to welcome everyone to the 2009 Second Quarter Investor Conference Call. All


lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks


there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.


Mr. Robin Raina, you may begin your conference.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Yeah. Good morning. Good morning, gentleman. Thank you for attending Ebix’s 2009 second


quarter investor conference call. I have also here with me Ebix’s CFO Robert Kerris. Our Q2 2009


results were announced a few hours back. Let me summarize those results for you.


Second quarter 2009 results were yet again record results, the best ever in Ebix’s history in terms


of diluted EPS, net income and revenues. Each of the last many quarters has been a record result


with each quarter beating all the preceding quarters in our 33-year history as a company.


As a management team, we have believed in being consistent rather than producing spectacular


quarters. You could compare these results to the second quarter of 2008 or the first quarter of


2009, and all comparisons will show that the present quarter scores over all these quarters on all


four key criteria, growth in revenues, net income, diluted EPS and net margins.


Let us delve a bit deeper into this – into these numbers. A comparison of the second quarter 2009


numbers to the second quarter 2008 numbers reveals that all four, namely revenue, income,


EBITDA and diluted EPS grew in this quarter as compared to second quarter of 2008.


Revenue grew 26% from 17.8 million to 22.42. EBITDA grew 33% from 7.8 million to 10.4 million,


operating income grew 34% from 6.91 million to 9.26 million, net income grew 41% from 6.34


million to 8.96 million. Our diluted EPS grew 35% from $0.54 to $0.73 and the basic EPS grew 35%


from $0.65 to $0.88. The net margin numbers grew from 36% to 40%. The diluted share count grew


4% from 11.98 million shares to 12.49 million shares.


Let’s now compare these results to the first quarter 2009 results. A comparison of the Q2 2009


numbers to the Q1 2009 numbers reveals that all four, namely, revenue, income, EBITDA and


diluted EPS grew in this quarter as compared to Q1 of 2009. Our revenues grew 8.47% from 20.67


million to 22.42, our EBITDA grew 9.47% from 9.5 million to 10.4 million. Our operating income


grew 10.81% from 8.36 million to 9.26 million. Our net income grew 7.5% from 8.34 million to 8.96


million and the diluted EPS grew 5.85% from $0.69 to $0.73 and the net margin numbers remained


consistent at 40%.


The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar as much as 15% with respect to the Indian rupee,


20% with respect to the Australian dollar, 22% with respect to the New Zealand dollar, and 7% with


respect to Singapore dollar, as compared to the second quarter of 2008, had an adverse effect on


our financial results. For those of you who like to look at currency neutral results, I have some


numbers for you.


Currency-adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2009 grew to 23.8 million, a 33.8% increase


over the second quarter of 2008. Currency-adjusted net income after taxes in the second quarter of


2009 grew to 9.9 million, a 55.6% increase over the second quarter of 2008. Basically, what it


means is that if you were to keep currency rates constant between Q2 2009 and Q2 2008, Ebix’s


revenues would have been 1.4 million higher and net income would have been $789,000 higher.

Currency-adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use solely for comparing numbers


from two different periods without the impact of foreign exchange.


Ebix business is broken into four channels, the carrier channel, exchanges, broker channel and that


BPO channel. To look at the performance of these channels, I have a few numbers for you.


Exchange channel in the second quarter of 2009 grew 40.3% from 9.3 million to 13.1 million. The


BPO channel grew 104% from 1.8 million to 3.7 million. The broker channel went down 24.4% from


3.7 million to 2.84 million. The carrier systems channel went down by 5% from 2.8 million to 2.7


million.


When you compare the performance between Q2 2009 and Q1 of 2009, exchanges grew 9.38%,


BPO grew 10.5%, broker systems grew 14.3% and the carrier systems went down 4%. When you


look at these numbers, the broker channel was mostly impacted downwardly by the currency


fluctuation and the fact that newer decisions are harder to get by these days.


Our broker business is mainly international and thus currency fluctuations impacted the most. We


are not overly concerned with this as the broker channel is one of our more – one of our most


recurring revenue bases with a strong business pipeline at any time. To add to that, our recent


strides, especially in New Zealand, Europe and Asia have given us reason to believe that this


channel will continue to be the strong pillar for Ebix.


The carrier channel was somewhat downwardly impacted, and it was mostly impacted primarily


because of carriers delaying decisions and doing budgetary decisions in the present economy;


again, we believe that while we have work to do in the carrier channel, we believe that there is no


reason for concern.


Our pipeline continues to be good with many well-established – well – with many well-awaited deals


having been agreed to in the last 90 days. In the area of exchanges and BPO with the who’s who of


the market, both in the financial world and Fortune 500 companies, the economic environment


continues to create pressure on insurance companies, reducing their spending. But Ebix has


continued to use its cross selling to open up new opportunities and keep revenues growing.


We continue to work on improving our balance sheet and are committed towards significantly


reducing the debt on the balance sheet. At June 30, 2009, the total convertible debt balance stood


at 19.81 million with 5.31 million maturing in December 2009 and 14.5 million maturing in July


2010. Both the converts are in the money and the common stock after conversion is already fully


counted in our diluted EPS count for the calculation of quarterly and annual EPS results, as if it has


already been converted.


So how do we judge our own performance in the second quarter of 2009? Most companies look at


their performance relative to their peers and competitors to gauge the degree of their success. Over


the years, like other companies, Ebix had to make a choice between top line growth and high


margins. We decided to take the difficult route of going for both, high margins and decent growth.


We decided to charter our own path by setting new benchmarks for any on-demand software


company in the United States, in terms of net margins. We have always believed that high margins


are not a function of the line of business you are in, but a function of common sense business


mathematics, which dictates that selling price must be a lot higher than the cost price.


As you know, there has been a considerable slowdown in the economy across the world. Our goal


has been to build a company that does not just build its business around a great economic time, but


is also prepared for its occasional unpredictable volatility. Our obligation has been to build a


company that can thrive in any environment. We believe that a good company needs to capitalize


on its strength to grow aggressively in downturns, when its competition is unable to do so. The


mark of an exceptional company is consistently good performance relative to itself, its peers and its
