energy and construction projects around the world. We continue to expand our business and


maintain a high level of customer service, while implementing our accelerated drydock and vessel


upgrade program. We develop new trade wells in the Mediterranean and the Pacific basin and


expanded our fleet to 35 vessels through the acquisition of Handymax and a Handysize Bulk


Carrier to be delivered in the fourth quarter 2007. Our accelerated drydock and vessel upgrade


program is on schedule.


We completed the retrofitting of the motor vessel Seminole Princess, the Tweendecker in July


2007. We expect to complete the retrofitting of the motor vessel Laguna Belle in September 2007.


We believe TBS is strategically positioned to benefit from the robust demand for commodities and


general cargos on a global scale and from the strength in the freight rates.


Now, I would like to turn the floor over to Fred Lepere, our Executive Vice President and Chief


Financial Officer.


Ferdinand V. Lepere, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Joe. Everyone we should now be on Slide #5, which is the second quarter 2007


operating and financial highlights. While reflecting stronger market conditions, our second quarter


2007 revenues, net income and EBITDA which is a non-GAAP financial measure increased


substantially compared to the second quarter of 2006. Fully diluted earnings per share increased to


$0.77 compared to $0.25 in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding items footnoted below, earnings


per share were $0.56 in the second quarter 2007 compared to $0.29 in the second quarter of 2006.


These results were especially satisfying, considering that TBS’s vessels were in drydock for 350


days during the second quarter of 2007compared to only 85 days in the same period of 2006.


Please let’s now move to Slide #6. This slide demonstrates the revenue metrics of our business for


the second quarter of 2007. We begin with our voyage data on the top of the slide. On the previous


slide we showed that voyage revenues in the second quarter 2007 were 60.9 million, an increase of


17.1 million or 39% from the $43.8 million during the same period in 2006.


In the second quarter of 2007, we operated 22 vessels in our freight voyage business and had


2009 freight voyage days compared to 21 vessels and 1866 freight voyage days for the same


period in 2006. Our average daily voyage time charter equivalent was $19,247 per day in the


second quarter of 2007, an increase of 62.4% from the $11,849 per day during the same period of


2006 and an increase of 15% from the $16,740 per day during the first quarter 2007.


Now, let’s move to the lower portion of the chart and look at time charter data. Time charter


revenues in the second quarter 2007 increased by $1.3 million or 8.8% to 16.1 million from 14.8


million in the same period of last year, despite the fact that time charter days decreased to 839


days in the second quarter 2007 from the 1125 days in the second quarter 2006 reflecting an


increase of 46% in the daily charter out higher rate. Our average daily time charter equivalent was


$18,134 in the three months ended June 30th 2007, an increase of 49.3% from the $12,145 per


day during the same period of 2006 and an increase of 9.8% from the $16,515 per day during the


first quarter of 2007.


Now, Slide 7 & 8 to pick our operating and financial highlights, as well as key metrics for the six


months of 2007. These slides are self explanatory and the information is presented in more detail in


our second quarter and six months 2007 earnings press release we issued yesterday. I will answer


any questions you may have during the question and answer session of our conference call.


We now turn to slide number #9, consolidated balance sheet highlights. This slide provides the


highlights of our consolidated balance sheet at June 30th 2007 and at December 31st 2006. At
