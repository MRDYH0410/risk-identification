MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the National RV Holdings third [sic


fourth] quarter fiscal year 2004 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder this


conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Laurie Little,


Director of Investor Relations for National RV Holdings, thank you Ms. Little you may begin.


Laurie Little, Director, Investor Relations


Thanks, Diego, and good morning and thanks everyone for joining us today to discuss National RV


Holdings’ fourth quarter and year-end 2004 financial results. Participating in today's call are Brad


Albrechtsen, President and Chief Executive Officer; Joseph Hansen, Chief Financial Officer; and


Jay Howard, President of Country Coach Division. Before turning the call over Brad please let me


briefly go over our Safe Harbor Statement.


The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and


uncertainties. Actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated, believed,


estimated or otherwise indicated including a change in economic and market conditions, any


material weaknesses in NRVH’s internal controls over financial reporting, dependence upon certain


dealers and suppliers, potential product liabilities and warranty claims, unexpected manufacturing


delays, government regulation and competition and those matters set forth in the risk factors listed


in National RV Holdings’ filings on Form 10-K and 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange


Commission.


These forward-looking statements represent the company's judgment as of the date of this


conference call and the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking


statements. However we may choose to update them and if we do so we will disseminate the


updates to the investing public. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Brad Albrechtsen. Brad?


Bradley Albrechtsen, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Laurie. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. By now all of you


should have received a copy of our news release that went out earlier today with the results of the


company's fourth quarter and full year operations.


The highlights of our results for the year are as follows. First 2004 was our first profitable year


since 2000. We have clearly turned the corner from our $2.19 loss two years ago to an $0.84 loss


in 2003 to income of $0.24 in 2004. Both our Perris and our Junction City operations experienced


year-over-year revenue growth with the most outstanding increase coming from our highline


business in Junction City where net sales increased $90 million or 66% over 2003. Later on the


call Jay Howard, the President of Country Coach, will talk about that division and some of the


things going on there.


Both divisions also saw gross margin improvements of 300 to 600 basis points in 2004 compared to


2003. While we failed to meet our goal of sequential quarterly improvement in gross margins, we


did make significant progress year-over-year improving our gross margin from continuing


operations from 2.5% in 2003 to 7.5% in 2004 and while we don’t disclose detailed operating


results for our two divisions, it is important to note that with the improvements in gross margins both


divisions generated operating profits for the year. Both divisions were also aggressive in their new


product introductions and we will talk about some of this as Jay and I report on the individual


operating units later in the call.

We also had success in 2004 and we will continue our efforts in 2005 of controlling costs. Although


in this area we certainly have further to go before we achieve competitive margins, we are pleased


with the progress we made. In general, the industry has experienced, is expecting a solid year in


2005, but one that is off slightly from 2004. In the Class A segment in which we operate


expectations are that unit shipments will be off approximately 5% in 2005. According to statistical


surveys, we improved our retail market share by 9.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. Also in 2004 our


wholesale Class A unit shipments increased 24% compared to a 12% increase in the industry.


I would also like to comment on our disclosure regarding Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance and the


fact that we believe we have some material weaknesses. First, let me restate, that while combined


we do consider the internal control deficiencies to rise to the level of material weaknesses such


weaknesses have not resulted in material errors in the financial statements as reported. SOx 404


sets the bar extremely high and in a couple of areas we failed to meet those very high standards by


year-end. Out of the literally hundreds of processes and controls that were documented and tested


at significant cost and effort, we did not make it in a couple of areas. We regret this and as


indicated in the release, are taking remedial actions to ensure future compliance. Again, I want to


emphasize that the deficiencies did not result in material errors in the financial statements.


With that I will turn the call over to Joe to review the numbers, Joe will then be followed by Jay


Howard, who will discuss Country Coach operations. I will then discuss National RV operations in


greater detail. Joe.


Joseph Hansen, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Brad. For purposes of my discussions all comparisons reference only continuing


operations. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $101.3 million, which represented an increase of


$8 million or 9% from the fourth quarter last year. Net sales for the year 2004 were up $128 million


or 41% over last year. The gross margin for this year's fourth quarter was 6.7% compared to 7.2%


for last year's fourth quarter. The Q4 2004 gross margin was 6.7% versus 7.2% for Q4 2003.


Among the factors accounting for this difference were production inefficiencies and increased


engineering and product development costs. These were partially offset by fixed costs being


spread over higher sales and production volumes and improved workers’ compensation and


warranty costs.


Selling expenses were $3.8 million or 3.8% of sales for Q4 2004 compared to $3 million or 3.2% of


sales in Q4 2003. For the year selling expenses were $13.7 million or 3.1% of sales compared to


$11.2 million or 3.6% of sales for 2003. The increase in sales resulted in increased selling


expenses including sales commissions, marketing materials and spiffs. Selling expenses as a


percentage of sales decreased due to higher sales over which fixed selling expenses were spread.


General and administrative expenses were $4.2 million or 4.2% of sales for Q4, 2004 compared to


1.9 million or 2% of sales in Q4, 2003.


For 2004 general and administrative expenses were $12.9 million or 2.9% of sales compared to


$7.3 million or 2.3% for 2003. Of the $2.3 million quarterly year-over-year increase and $5.6 million


year-over–year increase, $1.2 million, and $1.6 million were due to SOx-related expenses


excluding SOx-related internal costs, respectively. Increased personnel expenses and an


employee incentive program constituted much of the remaining difference for both the quarterly,


year-over-year and the 2004 versus 2003 comparisons. The resulting operating loss was $1.5


million for the fourth quarter compared to operating income of 1.9 million for the same quarter last


year. The operating income for the year was $6.1 million compared to an annual operating loss of


$10.6 million for 2003.
