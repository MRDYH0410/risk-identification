MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the Cardica Fourth Quarter and Year end


Fiscal 2007 Conference Call. My name is Sean and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time


all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session


towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn presentation


over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Bob Newell, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.


Robert Newell, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for participating in our fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and


year-end financial results conference call. Earlier today we issued our financial press release, so


please refer to the release for complete details. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we


will be making forward-looking statements about the Company’s future expectations and plans,


including corporate, product, clinical and financial projections. Such statements are subject to risk


and uncertainties that could cause the results to differ materially from our projections including


among other risks associated with market acceptance of Cardica C-Port systems, manufacturing of


the C-Port systems, Cardica sales marketing and distribution strategy and capabilities, Cardica’s


ability to obtain regulatory clearance to market the C-Port Flex A system in Europe, the


development and introduction of the cartridge-based C-Port system, the launch of C-Port xV


system, the timing and success of pre-clinical studies of and regulatory activities related to the


Cook Vascular Access Closure Device and specialized PFO closure device, and the timing of


completion and success of the multinational clinical trial using Cardica’s PAS-Port system, as well


as other risks detailed from time to time in Cardica’s SEC reports, including its quarterly report on


Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31st, 2007. Cardica does not undertake any obligation to


update forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to read the Company’s reports filed with


the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, available at: www.sec.gov. I’ll now turn the call


over to Bernard Hausen, Cardica’s President, CEO and Co-Founder, to give a business update.


Bernard A. Hausen, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you Bob, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on our call today. We’ve had


a very good quarter and fiscal year at Cardica. Having achieved key commercial development and


corporate milestones. I’d like to review the recent highlights before turning the call to Bob for the


financial specific. As of June 30th, we had trained 163 surgeons on the use and benefits of our C-


Port system in the U.S. We’ve launched the C-Port Flex A Distal Anastomosis System and


extension of our C-Port product line with a flexible rather than rigid shaft. This device has been very


well received, as it allows surgeons to consistently reliably create complied anastomosis in areas of


the heart that our hard to reach and particularly difficult to hand suture, especially during beating


heart procedures.


Japan sales of our PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System continues to be strong with the


consistent sell-through of greater than 150 units per month for fiscal 2007, up over 25% for the


second year in a row. Based on the success of our partnership with Century Medical, in April we


extended our agreement to allow them to distribute the PAS-Port System through July 2014. In


June, we entered into a new agreement with Cook Medical to develop and commercialize a


specialized device designed to close the patent foramen ovale, so PFO, a relatively common heart


defect present in approximately 15 to 20% of the general population.


And during the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter we strengthened our balance sheet with the restructuring


of outstanding debts to Century and the completion of a private placement resulting in 11.9 million


in gross proceeds to Cardica. I will go into more detail for each of these areas later in the call, but

first I would like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial review of the quarter and guidance for


fiscal 2008.


Robert Newell, Chief Financial Officer


Thanks Bernard. Looking at the specifics for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, total net revenue


increased to $1 million compared to $889,000 in fiscal 2006 fourth quarter. Product revenue for the


fiscal 2007 fourth quarter was $679,000 compared to 379,000 in the same period in fiscal 2006.


In the fourth quarter, we shipped 480 C-Port systems bringing the cumulative worldwide shipments


to over 1900 units, and in a fourth quarter we shipped 610 PAS-Port systems bringing the


cumulative worldwide shipments to 5900.


Cost of product revenue was $726,000 for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter compared to 831,000 for


the same period in fiscal 2006. Total operating cost and expenses for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter


was 5.2 million versus 4.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2006. For the fiscal 2007 fourth


quarter the net loss was $4 million or $0.34 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.7 million or


$0.39 per share in the comparable period of fiscal 2006.


In conjunction with the extension of our distribution agreement with Century Medical for the PAS-


Port system, we restructured and reduced our $3 million net payable, note payable to Century. We


made a $1 million principle payment at the time of the extension in April 2007, and the remaining $2


million indebtedness is now due in 2010 rather than the original date of 2008.


Also during the 2007 fourth quarter, we raised $11.9 million in gross proceeds from the sale of 2.3


million shares of our common stock and the issuance of warrants for the purchase of 575,000


additional shares. As of June 30th, 2007, there were 13.606 million shares outstanding. Cash and


cash equivalents in investment at June 30th, 2007 were $23.4 million, which includes a net


proceeds of a private placement. This compares to 32.1 million at June 30, 2006, and 16.6 million


at March 31st, 2007. Importantly, we reduced our long-term debt from nearly 16 million as of June


30th, 2006 to 2 million as of June 30th, 2007.


Let me now turn to our financial guidance for fiscal year 2008. For fiscal 2008, Cardica expects total


net revenue of $6 million to $8 million, with product revenue of between $4 million and $5 million,


and collaboration revenue of between $2 million and $3 million. Cardica anticipates its fiscal 2008


Research & Development sales, general and administrative cost will total between $20 million and


$21 million, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2 million.


The net loss for fiscal 2008 is anticipated to be between $16 million and $18 million.


At this time I would like to turn the call back to Bernard for more detail on the quarter and milestone


guidance for the next 12 months.


Bernard A. Hausen, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Bob. It is a very busy time at Cardica, and there is a tremendous amount of excitement


about what is on the horizon, as we are beginning to realize our vision of enabling sternal-sparing


bypass procedures. Within the next 12 to 18 months we expect to offer a full range of anastomotic


product, which will allow surgeons to perform completely minimally invasive CABG surgery.


In May, June and July, at three different medical meetings, leading international cardiothoracic


surgeons performed live cases and presented key data highlighting the long-term patentcy in


results, using the C-Port and PAS-Port system.
