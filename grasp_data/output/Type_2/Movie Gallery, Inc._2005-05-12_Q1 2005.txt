MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Excuse me everyone. Thank you for holding. We now have Movie Gallery's management


team in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. And at the


conclusion of the presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be


given as the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.


I would now like to turn the conference over to Thomas Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may proceed.


Thomas D. Johnson, Jr., Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and Business Development


Thank you, Adam. Good morning everyone. This is Thomas Johnson for Movie Gallery. I would like


to welcome everyone to the Company's 2005 First Quarter Conference Call. This morning, we have


a few remarks from Ivy Jernigan, our CFO; and Joe Malugen, our Chairman and CEO. After these


remarks, we will be happy to take some of your questions.


Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking


information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including


statements regarding our future financial performance. For this purpose, any statements made


during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking

We refer you to our SEC filings, which contain a more detailed description of our forward-looking

whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.


I will now turn the call over to Ivy Jernigan, our CFO.


Ivy M. Jernigan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Thomas, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by providing some brief


highlights of the results we achieved in the first quarter. Total revenue in the first quarter was 233.8


million, an increase of 30.5 million or 15% from 203.3 million in the same period a year ago. The


increase in total revenue was primarily driven by a 14% increase in our store base and a 1.5%


increase in same-store sales.


Since the end of the first quarter of 2004, our store base has grown by 303 stores to 2,543 stores.


During the first quarter of 2005, we added a net total of 61 stores, which was comprised of 62 new


stores, 18 acquired stores and 19 store closures. Accordingly, at quarter end, we had 2,330 stores


in the United States, 206 stores in Canada, and 7 stores in Mexico. This, of course, excludes the


acquisition of the 2027 Hollywood stores which was completed just 2 weeks ago.


Look at our revenue mix for the quarter, rental revenue was 216.7 million or 92.7% of total


revenues versus 186.8 million or 91.9% of total revenues in the comparable period last year. Our


overall movie rental comps were up approximately 4.5% during the first quarter. DVD revenue


comprised over 85% of movie rental revenues for the first quarter of 2005 versus approximately


70% for the first quarter of 2004. Our game business was down approximately 15.5% in the first


quarter, reflecting the continued overall weakness of the new game titles currently being released,


which is consistent with industry softness that occurs in anticipation of the introduction of new game

platforms. Product sales were 17.1 million or 7.3% of total revenues versus 16.5 million or 8.1% of


total revenues in the first quarter of last year.


Moving on down the P&L, total gross profit was $155.2 million, an increase of 10.4% or $14.6


million from 140.6 million in the 2004 first quarter. Rental gross profit was 150.4 million or a 69.4%


rental margin compared to last year’s rental gross profit of 135 million or a 72.3% rental margin,


which is one of the strongest in our history. The decrease in the rental margin was anticipated and


was driven by higher than normal promotional activity of previously viewed products and an


increase in our rental inventory amortization due to the concentration of nearly 50% of our rental


inventory purchases occurring in the beginning of the quarter. Gross profit on product sales was 4.9


million or a 28.5% sell-through gross margin versus a gross profit on product sales of 5.6 million or


a 33.9% sell-through gross margin in the first quarter of 2004.


Our store operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained constant at 46.4% in the first


quarter of both years. During the first quarter of 2005, our store operating expenses were 108.5


million, which includes a lease accounting charge of approximately $675,000 or $0.01 per share of


depreciation expense relating to our lease accounting changes made in the fourth quarter of 2004.


Our general and administrative expenses were 15.5 million or 6.6% of total revenues, which is an


improvement of 20 basis points when compared to the 13.8 million or 6.8% of total revenues in the


first quarter of 2004.


Our operating income was 30.6 million or 13.1% of total revenues compared to 31.7 million or


15.6% of total revenues in the 2004 first quarter. Again, as we just discussed, this was driven by


the promotional activity of previously viewed products and the increase in rental inventory


amortization. Net income was 18.4 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared 18.3 million or


$0.54 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004.


Adjusted EBITDA was 39.2 million or 16.8% of total revenues, an increase of 14.2% over the 34.3


million or 16.9% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2004.


I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Joe Malugen.


J. T. Malugen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by


saying how pleased I am with the sales and the profits that we achieved in this quarter. We had a


very solid quarter in which we increased revenues, we met consensus estimates and achieved


same-store sales at the high end of our guidance for the quarter. In addition to our strong financial


results, this quarter was especially exciting because we completed our acquisition of Hollywood


Entertainment.


As you know, about 2 weeks ago, we completed the acquisition of Hollywood, creating the second


largest North American home video retailer. With our new Hollywood subsidiary, Movie Gallery and


Hollywood will have annual revenue in excess of $2.5 billion and more than 4,500 stores located in


all 50 U.S. states, Canada, and Mexico. We are very excited about this transaction because like


Movie Gallery, Hollywood is a strong company with a long history of growth and success. Over the


last 17 years, Hollywood has grown from a single local video store to an industry leader with more


than 2,000 Hollywood Video superstores and more than 700 Game Crazy specialty retail outlets


nationwide. Hollywood is a great brand. We are committed to maintaining the Hollywood


headquarters in Wilsonville, Oregon, and continuing to operate stores under the Hollywood name.


We are moving quickly to integrate the two companies and want to welcome the people of


Hollywood to our team. Hollywood's people, like Movie Gallery's, are its most valuable asset. We
