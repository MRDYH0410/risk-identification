MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Tandy’s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2010 Earnings


Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer


session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is


being recorded.


It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Craig Mackey, CFO for Tandy Brands Accessories.


Thank you Mr. Mackey, you may begin.


M. C. Mackey, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you. I’d like to read the Safe Harbor language. Expect for historical information contained


herein, the statements on this call are forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor


provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements


involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause the company’s actual results


in the future periods to differ materially from forecasted or expected results.


Those risks include among other things, the competitive environment in the industry, in general,


and in the company’s specific market areas; inflation; changes in cost of the goods and services;


and economic conditions in general and in the company’s specific market areas. Those and other


risks are more fully described in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange


Commission.


I would now like to turn the call over to Rod McGeachy, our President and CEO.


N. Roderick McGeachy III, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Craig, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your


continued interest in the company. On the call today I’ll have some brief introductory comments and


then Craig will go into more detail regarding the financial results, after that I’ll review some of the


key developments of the quarter and then update our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2010. Then


we’ll open the call to your questions.


Overall, we’re very pleased with the results for both the second quarter and for the first half. If


you’ve had a moment to digest our written statement, you’ll see that we’ve tried to provider


additional insight into our performance by including a measure called adjusted EBITDA, which


highlights our profitability before non-cash items like depreciation and amortization as well as one-


time gains and expenses associated with the Chambers Belt acquisition.


For the second quarter of fiscal 2010 ended December 31, 2009, Tandy reported a 13% increase in


net sales to $48.4 million versus net sales of $42.9 million in the second quarter of 2009.


Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.6 million more than double the $1.7 million adjusted


EBITDA posted in the second quarter of 2009. We believe that this adjusted EBITDA is a truer


measure of our company’s ongoing health and are pleased to see this improvement in this


important measure.


Net income for the quarter, including some unusual items that Craig will explain later, was $6.8


million or $0.95 per diluted share. Without the unusual items, we would have reported net income of

$2 million or $0.28 per share, a significant improvement of over last year’s net income of $952,000


or $0.14 per share.


For the first half, we’re pleased that net sales are $85.5 million, up 10% from last year. We’re also


pleased net income was $7.9 million or $1.11 per share, which is dramatically better than last


year’s loss of $328,000 or $0.05 per share.


More importantly, adjusted EBITDA for the first half was $4.7 million, a 3.5 time increase over last


year’s $1.4 million. We believe that these improvements in net sales, adjusted EBITDA and net


income in the midst of a challenging retail environment firmly indicate that our management


strategies are working.


Now, I’ll turn it back over to Craig, who’ll provide a more detailed review of our financial results.


M. C. Mackey, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Rod. To reiterate the company’s financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010,


the company reported net sales of $48.4 million and net income of $6.8 million or $0.95 per diluted


share. For the second quarter of 2009, the company reported net sales of $42.9 million and net


income of $952,000 or $0.14 per share. Fiscal 2010 net income result included unusual items,


including a pre-tax gain of $339,000 associated with the sale of a warehouse in Yoakum, Texas,


and an income tax benefit of $4.4 million from realizing net operating loss carrybacks as a result of


tax law changes that occurred in November 2009. Excluding these items the company would have


reported net income of $2.0 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31,


2009.


For the second quarter 2010, adjusted EBITDA was $3.6 million compared to $1.7 million in 2009.


Obviously adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement and a reconciliation of this to our


financial statements is provided in our news release.


A couple of quick points on some of the key items on the income statement, net sales increased


13% in the quarter driven by incremental sales generated by the Chambers Belt acquisition that


was closed in July of 2009.


The accessories segment primarily belts and small leather goods generated net sales of $34.9


million in the current quarter, a 28% increase over the year ago second quarter results. Chamber


related sales totaled $10.3 million.


Gifts segment sales in the quarter were $13.5 million versus $15.8 million a year ago. The decline


was due to the timing of sales between the first and second quarters of each year. Gifts segment


year-to-date net sales declined 2% from $19.2 million in fiscal 2009 to $18.9 million this year.


Our gross margin for the current year’s second quarter was 35.8% compared to 36.7% in the


second quarter of fiscal 2009, a small decline was due primarily to shift in the product mix to lower


price point items. Gross margins in the gifts segment increased to 39.4% versus 34.3% in 2009,


primarily due to improved product sourcing.


SG&A expenses for the most recent quarter were $14 million, basically flat with year-ago results


and down as a percentage of sales from 32.8% of net sales to 29%. The company’s operating


margin percentage for the quarter improved to 5.3% versus 2.8% in 2009.


For the six months of 2010, net sales were $85.5 million, a 10% increase over net sales of $77.6


million in 2009. Net income in 2010 was $7.9 million or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with a
