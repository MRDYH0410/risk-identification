MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Lannett Fiscal 2009 Second


Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.


Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being


recorded.


I will now turn the call over to Mr. Robert Jaffe, Investor Relations for Lannett Company. Mr. Jaffe


you may begin.


Robert Jaffe, Senior Vice President, PondelWilkinson Inc


Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss


Lannett Company’s fiscal 2009 second quarter financial results. On the call today are Arthur


Bedrosian, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Kearns, Chief Financial Officer.


First some housekeeping before we start. Please be advised that this conference call is being


broadcast live on the Internet at www.lannett.com. A playback of this call will be available for three


months and may be accessed on the Internet at Lannett’s website.


Before we begin, I would like to make the cautionary statement and remind everyone that all of the


information discussed on the call today is covered under the Safe Harbor provisions of the


Litigation Reform Act. The company’s discussion today will include forward-looking information


reflecting management’s current forecast of certain aspects of the company’s future and our actual


results could differ materially from those stated or implied.


With that said, let me turn the call over to Arthur Bedrosian. Arthur?


Arthur P. Bedrosian, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Robert and good afternoon everyone. I’m pleased all of you can join us today to discuss


our fiscal 2009 second quarter financial results. I’ll begin with a brief review of the quarter, then turn


the call over to Brian to provide a more detailed description of the financial results, and then I will


make some concluding remarks.


For those new to our company, Lannett is the oldest generic drug company in the United States.


We manufacture, market, and distribute a variety of prescription medications in tablet, liquid, topical


and capsule forms.


In April of 2007, we acquired Cody Laboratories, a small privately-owned manufacturer and supplier


of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients known in the industry as APIs. The acquisition of Cody


will help facilitate growth and expand our product offering. This past summer Cody received an


import license for concentrated poppy straw otherwise known as CPS, from the Drug Enforcement


Agency, otherwise known as DEA. The import license provides us with the capability to enter the


pain management market, which has relatively few competitors and favorable demographics.


We began manufacturing hydromorphone, our first API product, and plan to introduce four


additional products beginning early calendar year 2009.


Looking at our topline growth in the quarter, most of it was fueled by strong sales of several key


products including our prescription prenatal vitamin as well as growth of our base business


products. In fiscal 2008, we received six ANDA approvals, which should help fuel our future


performance.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Brian Kearns. Brian?


Brian J. Kearns, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Arthur, and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of fiscal 2009, net sales grew


to 29.2 million from 17.5 million in last year’s second quarter, a 67% increase.


Net income was 1.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share versus a net loss of 658,000 or $0.03 per


share in last year’s second quarter. Gross profit increased 11 million or 38% of net sales, compared


with 4.4 million or 25% of net sales for the prior year’s second quarter. Research and development


expenses were 1.8 million compared with 946,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2008.


Selling, general and administrative expenses were 6.7 million compared with 4.3 million in last


year’s second quarter. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to litigation expenses related to our


current patent challenge.


With that brief financial overview, I would like to quickly mention that Arthur and I will be presenting


at Roth Capital’s Investor Conference in California next week, and we will be happy to meet with


any of you who might be there.


So with that, I’d now like to turn the call back over to Arthur.


Arthur P. Bedrosian, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Brian. Over the last several years, we’ve done an excellent job of building our pipeline,


which now includes a number of ANDAs pending at the FDA and a large number of additional


product candidates in various stages of development.


We have complemented our internal drug development effort with the establishment of several


strategic alliances which have added and rounded out our product offering.


Let me briefly address the key topics before we open the call to questions. Currently, we are


involved in a patent litigation lawsuit. Our case is very strong and we believe we will prevail. That


litigation will begin in March 23 in the Delaware Court and we believe the trial will last about five


days. We believe Lannett is well positioned for growth and it looks like its future will be very bright.


With the time available, we’d like to address any questions you may have. Operator?
