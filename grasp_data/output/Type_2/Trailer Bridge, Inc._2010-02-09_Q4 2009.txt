MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Trailer Bridge 2009 Fourth Quarter


Conference Call. At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and


that all participants are currently in a listen-only mode.


I will now turn the conference over Mr. Allen Stevens, Chairman of Trailer Bridge.


Allen L. Stevens, Chairman


Thank you, Operator. I wish to welcome you to Trailer Bridge’s fourth quarter conference call. On


the call today is Ivy Suter, CEO, Mark Tanner, CFO, and Bill Gotimer, our General Counsel.


The best news is that Trailer Bridge is reporting a profit for 2009 of 2.6 million or $0.22 per share,


versus a loss of $0.27 in 2008. This is our first annual profit since 2005. This turnaround has been


accomplished in the face of a declining freight market and a very difficult economy in Puerto Rico.


I’ll turn the call over to Ivy for her report.


Ivy Barton Suter, Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today’s remarks are


prefaced with the usual Safe Harbor language. This call will contain forward-looking statements


within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking


statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve the usual risks and uncertainties.


Among those risks are those listed in our press release of yesterday, including the statement that


the fourth quarter and year-end 2009 financial statements are unaudited.


With us on the call are Trailer Bridge’s Chief Financial Officer, Mark Tanner, and our Executive Vice


President and General Counsel, Bill Gotimer. I will review the overall performance and Mark Tanner


will walk you through the details of our financial performance. Then we’ll open up for questions.


We released our 2009 fourth quarter financial results yesterday which included increased


profitability with operating income of $3.6 million, net income of $1 million, earnings of $0.08 per


basic and diluted share, 5.2 million in EBITDA and 6.8 million of adjusted EBITDA. These results


were lessened by severance charges of 690,000 for two reductions in force, which represent a


realignment of the Company, as well as legal fees, associated with the Department of Justice


investigation and associated class action litigation, which amounted to $696,000 in the quarter.


Our quarter and year-end results in 2009 are favorable year-over-year. Our fourth quarter was


profitable despite the softened market conditions in Puerto Rico. The flexibility of our systems’


assets contributed to improved asset utilization and profitability in our core Puerto Rico business.


The Dominican Republic service continues to complement our vessel utilization in both directions.


Overall, vessel utilization for the quarter was 92% southbound and 29.8% northbound.


Operationally, we continued to perform well by keeping costs under control and in line with our


plans. Based on January results, we expect utilization to remain high in 2010. We completed the


dry-docking of one TBC vessel in December 2009, which will take us into 2011 before the next dry-


docking schedule of the railroad.


In terms of charter hire, it was a good quarter with approximately 96% of the available days being


utilized. This market continues to remain active and has good prospects. Our CapEx for 2010 is


estimated at $6 million, primarily for the replacement of our ramp turn deck structure in Puerto Rico.

I’ll now turn the call over to Mark Tanner, who will walk us through the financials. Mark?


Mark A. Tanner, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Ivy, and good morning. As Ivy mentioned earlier, our total revenue was 30.7 million for


the quarter, up 409,000 or 1% sequentially on a 908,000 or 4% increase in freight revenue that was


partially offset by 216,000 or 5% less fuel surcharge revenue and 283,000 less charter hire. The


freight revenue increase resulted from a 7% improvement in overall equivalent unit yield, primarily


due to higher rates realized on special project cargo and a slightly higher average length of haul.


The favorable effect of the yield increase was partially offset by a 5% decrease in overall volume.


Southbound volume for Q4 was down 4% sequentially, despite the increase in utilization of 92%


from the 90% reached in Q3. One bright spot in the southbound lane was new car volume, which


was up 130%.


There were three less sailings in Q4, two southbound and one northbound, resulting in 6% less


capacity. Northbound volume was down 6% sequentially on 30% utilization, off 1% from the third


quarter with the one less voyage. The 8% revenue decline versus the prior-year period was driven


substantially by a 39% reduction in fuel surcharge revenue from 6.1 million to 3.8 million, which was


all related to the reduction in average fuel surcharge rate per load.


Overall volume compared to the prior year period was 2% higher, with northbound up 22% partially


offset by a 3% decline southbound. Operating income for the quarter is 3.6 million, an improvement


of 2.2 million or 148% over the same period last year, a decline of 523,000 or 13% sequentially,


and includes a $690,000 charge related to a non-recurring severance charge – non-recurring


severance for the reduction in force. Also, 676,000 of legal expenses related to the Department of


Justice investigation and $250,000 for the TBC dry-docking.


Fuel expense is up 5% sequentially on higher average fuel prices and higher consumption. Marine


fuel prices averaged $1.93 per gallon this quarter, up 4% sequentially and down 24% from the prior


year period. The net fuel cost for the quarter, which is the measure of our actual fuel expense plus


an estimate of the fuel cost embedded in our outside transportation expense, less our actual fuel


surcharge revenue, is 1.4 million, 394,000 or 39% higher sequentially and 483,000 or 52% higher


than the prior period.


Fuel prices increased each month during the quarter and we implemented two fuel surcharge rate


increases, one in early November and the other in late December. The $394,000 sequential


increase in net fuel cost was split between an increase in fuel expense and $200,000 less in


surcharge revenue. The $483,000 increase over the prior period is made up of $2.4 million revenue


shortfall, partially offset by a 1.9 million decrease in fuel expense. The fuel expense recovery rate


for the quarter is 73% versus 80% sequentially, and 89% last year.


Purchase transportation expense is flat, sequentially on 6% less miles related to the decreased


volume, partially offset by a 3% fuel related increase in cost per mile. Compared to the prior year


period, purchased transportation expense is down 1.5 million or 19% on 12% less inland miles and


a shift in truck deployment mix to more owner-operators and a lower cost per mile related to fuel.


The empty mile percentage was 32% for the quarter, a 3% improvement over the prior period and a


1% improvement sequentially. The mixed percentage of lower cost owner-operator miles continued


at the third quarter level at 25%, up from 14% in the prior period. The higher cost partner carrier


miles were down 57%.


Marine terminal variable expenses, which consist primarily of stevedoring and related, are up


152,000 sequentially due to a 5% increase in stevedoring cost per move. Compared to the prior


period, stevedoring and related costs are down 484,000 on lower volume and lower cost per move,
