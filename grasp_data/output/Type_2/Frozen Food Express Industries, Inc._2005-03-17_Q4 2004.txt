MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


<Operator:> Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter Four 2004 Frozen Food


Express Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Binoche [ph] and I’ll be your coordinator


for today. At this time all participant are in a listen-only mode. We will be conducting a question-


and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instruction]. As a reminder, this


conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I’ll now like to turn the presentation over to your


host for today's call, Mr. Stubbs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Frozen Food Express.


Please proceed Sir.


Stoney Stubbs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you very much. Good morning. This is Mit Stubbs. With me are Charles Robertson, our


Chief Operating Officer and Dixon McElwee, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin this call with


Dixon. So Dixon, why don't you take us off.


F. Dixon McElwee, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you Mit. Let me begin by making the following standard disclaimer about all the discussions


that we will be having this morning. This conference call contain information and forward-looking


statements that are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and assumptions,


which are based upon information currently available. Forward-looking statements, include


statements relating to plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of


resources and may be identified by words such as will, could, should, believe, expect intend, plan,


schedule, estimate, project and similar expressions. These statements are based on current


expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. Although management believes that the


expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable. There can be no


assurance that such expectations will be realized, should one or more of the risks or uncertainties


underlying such expectations not materialize or should underlying assumptions proven incorrect.


Actual results may vary materially from those expected.


First I want to sort out some facts before our 2004 – about our 2000 results – 2004 results. So you


can make up your own mind about what 2005 might look like.


Let's begin with freight revenue. One of the most revealing numbers to me is revenue per truck per


week. It was up 7% from $3,161 in 2003 to $3,374 in 2004. Our number of weekly average trucks in


service was flat at approximately 2,300. Our trucks travel more miles, from 227 million miles in '03


to 233 million miles in '04, that’s a 2.6% increase in miles traveled. Therefore, we increased our


fleets utilization in 2004 improving therefore it's productivity. Of the 7% increase in weekly average


per truck revenue, about 4.5% comes from rate increases and the other approximately 2.5% is a


result of the more efficient use of our fleet.


We also did a better job of controlling expenses in 2004. Several expense line items account for


about three-fourths of our freight expenses, salaries, wages and related expenses, purchase


transportation, supplies and expenses in fuel are these major categories. Our driver's weekly take-


home pay is up about 16% in '04 at the end of '04 compared to 2003. But our total salaries, wages


and related expenses for '04 was up by just under 5%, from 117.5 million in 2003 to 123.3 million in


2004. As a percentage of revenue, however this – however this expense item was lower in 2004


than it was in 2003, 26.5% compared to 28.9 %. Purchase transportation was up by almost 18% in


2004 compared to 2003 and it represented 27% of revenue in 2004 more than the 26.4% in 2003.


But this isn’t necessarily bad news. The purchase transportation expense line item is what we pay


on our operators for holding our customers freight in our trailers using their trac – their own tractors

and paying their own expenses. These independent contractors work for a percentage of revenue


that their loads generate. As their income goes up, so does ours. Supplies and expenses is a grand


array of numerous trucking costs which includes fleet repairs and maintenance, freight handling,


tire expense, turmoil [ph] expenses, driving, recruiting costs and other. It was 27.1% of freight


revenue in 2004 and 26.4% of freight revenue in 2003, thereby increasing by 17.6%, the largest


single component of which was fleet repairs.


Recently the most volatile item of expense has been fuel. Our 2004 fuel cost was 60.1 – $60.1


million compared to 47.5 million. This represents a 27% increase over the prior year. But we did a


fair job in recovering this increase using fuel routing tools, prudent purchasing processes in addition


to our fuel surcharges that we call charge our customers. Overall our operating ratio improved to


96.5% in 2004, from 97.1 in 2003. I will turn it over to Charles, to talk about, – at this time I will turn


it over to Charles to talk about 2004 operations, Charles?


Charles Robertson, Executive Vice President and Director


Okay, I want to comment on some of Dixon's discussions here about our fleet productivity for 2004.


One of our improved fleet utilizations is due to the high demand of our services. For example, the


shortage of truck refrigeration [ph] has enabled us not only to charge detention fees for our truck


that are held up to load or unload, but also to collect those fees. As a result of the detention fees we


are finding our drivers wait time has been reduced substantially. Less waiting time means more


time on the road, higher productivity and higher driver satisfaction. Another example, a lot of – in a


lot of cases if we didn’t have a truck near our shipper's pickup plant, to pick up a load the shipper


would pay us dead hit to this plant to get the load. That’s a new experience for us, it again


happened in 2003 and became more frequent in 2004 as the capacity diminished. And here is the


best example of what demand can do. Our average revenue for loaded mile is a best indicator of


the average mile right that we are getting. For the first quarter in 2004 our average rate for loaded


mile was $1.42, for the second quarter it was $1.49. It moved to $1.56 for the third quarter and


$1.63 for the fourth. That’s the kind of trend we like, it moved about $0.07 a quarter last year. So


the demand certainly helps improve our productivity, but was also been helping our productivity.


Last year we told you about the software system that we began installing to help us, optimize our


data operation. Most of this was up and running in late 2004 and has become an accepted ways to


do our business. The load assignment program looks at a 165 different facts before assigning the


load to a driver, one of the reasons we are using our fleet more efficiently. The drop ness slog


system [ph] has proved very efficient because it allows drivers to swap loads in around, get some


home more often, gets our freight delivered on time and keeps us within the new hours of service


limits. Our both systems have worked very well and have been a key driver retention item.


Speaking of drivers we don’t have enough and driver shortage is not getting any better. Last


summer during the second quarter conference call I told you that the lack of qualified drivers on any


given day was causing us to part from 1-2% of our fleet and that was 20 – 40 trucks. By the end of


2004 our parked empty state truck count was ranging from 1-3.5% of our fleet. At one time it had


got up to 80 trucks on a bad day.


As you may suspect there is a lot of discussion in our industry on how to clear the driver shortage. I


have just returned last week from the Truck Load Trailers Association annual meeting and I think it


is fair to say that the consensus at the meeting was that we would have to pay our drivers more


money per year in order to get an entry of the driving into our industry and that amount is going to


be about 60-65,000 a year in order to attract more drivers. For Frozen Food Express to get there


we have to give our drivers a raise and including fringes would be about $0.20 a mile. We have


worked very hard last year on getting an increase of about 5-6%, a $0.20 per mile increase would


mean the rate increase is at least 15%. I am afraid we – a few months are long ways from that at


this point. So we continue to strove for drivers and our shippers continues struggle so those for


trucks. Mit?
