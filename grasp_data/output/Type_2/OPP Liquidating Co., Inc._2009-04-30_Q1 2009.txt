Thanks, Keith. Welcome fellow shareholders. I am Bob Snyder, President and Chief Executive


Officer of Orchids Paper Products. It is great to speak with you again. In a quick recap of the year


2008, we achieved net sales of about $90.2 million, up 21% from the 2007 results and earnings per


share increased 98% to $0.79 per diluted share. In the first quarter of 2009, we achieved net sales


of over 23.6 million up 17% from last year’s first quarter and record earnings of $0.42 per diluted


share, a $0.33 increase over the first quarter of 2008, and a 367% improvement.


Our team accomplished the following results during the first quarter. In the paper making


manufacturing plant we had a record paper making production in the first quarter of 2009 of 13,135


tons, a 2% decrease over the same quarter last year. At the same time we made major repairs to


our primary clarifier in the waste water treatment plant and performed our annual utilities inspection


of our steam boiler and power systems. In the converting plant, we produced a record 1 million


cases in the first quarter, a 15% increase over the same quarter of last year. We had record


shipments in the first quarter of about 1.7 million cases, a 13% improvement over the first quarter of


2008. As we have previously reported, the company’s expansion project for the waste water free


treatment facility, to reduce biological oxygen demand in total suspended solids from its discharged


water, is well under construction.


All major equipment has been purchased and all major construction contracts have been let. We


are in – we are scheduled for completion by July 2009 and plan to be fully operational by August 1,

2009. We currently are reviewing our logistics operations and our strategy of employing a third


party warehouse. The results of this study may indicate a need to expand our current warehouse


facility and eliminate the use of the third party warehouse. If so, the cost of expanding our


warehouse is estimated at $8 million. Funding for this project would come from either cash earnings


or a new borrowing agreement or a combination of both.


We are also studying a project to purchase a new converting line to aid in our strategy to increase


sales and profitability and to consume all of our paper making production in our converting


operation. This project is in the early stage of evaluation and is expected to cost between 15 million


and $18 million. We are encouraged by the positive impact of the sustained improvements as a


result of the coordinated efforts of our management team and the Orchids workforce over the past


year and look forward to continued efforts and results in 2009. Now, I will turn it over to Keith to


discuss the financials.


Keith R. Schroeder, Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Bob. For the three months ended March 31, 2009 we report a quarterly record net


income of $2.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with net income of $611,000 or $0.09


per diluted share in the same period of 2008. Net sales for the first quarter of 2009 were $23.6


million, an increase of 17% over the $20.3 million in net sales we reported for the same period last


year. Net sales of converted products in the first quarter of 2009 increased 23% to $21 million,


which was primarily the result of a 23% increase in net selling prices.


The price increase was primarily due to product content changes and price increases taken during


2008. Net sales of parent rolls decreased $600,000 to 2.6 million, compared to 3.2 million in the


same period of 2008. Parent roll sales decreased due to a 14% decrease in the tonnage shipped


and a 4% decrease in net selling price. A soft parent roll market primarily due to a soft away-from-


home market is the primary reason for the lower parent roll sales.


The first quarter of each year tends to be the softest quarter for converted product shipments and


we are pleased that our converted product sales in the first quarter of 2009 were just slightly below


less than 1.5 of 1%, our record sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. EBITDA in the first quarter of


2009 was a new quarterly record at 5.4 million, which was an increase of 3.3 million over the 2.1


million reported in the first quarter of 2008. This was an increase of $1 million or the previous


record of $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a percent of net sales, EBITDA was 23.9% in


the 2009 quarter, compared to 10.2% reported in the first quarter of 2008.


Our improved results in the first quarter of 2009 were – are primarily the result of the increase in our


net selling price per ton for converted product and lower wastepaper prices. Our overall cost of


paper decreased a $131 per ton in the first quarter of 2009 to $687 per ton, compared to $818 per


ton in the first quarter of 2008. A 30% reduction in our cost of wastepaper in the quarter-over-


quarter comparison was the primary reason for the lower production cost.


The lower wastepaper cost improved earnings by approximately $1.4 million in the quarter. Also


affecting our cost of sales was lower natural gas cost and slightly higher converting production cost.


Natural gas prices were approximately 20% lower in the first quarter of 2009, compared with the


same period in 2008 thereby reducing our cost by approximately $260,000.


Our converting production costs were higher in the 2009 quarter, compared to the 2008 quarter,


primarily related to the higher maintenance repair costs of approximately 250,000 and higher costs


of outside warehousing of 190,000, which were partially offset by a lower direct labor costs of


240,000. Maintenance repair costs were about a $150,000 higher in the quarter than our ongoing


expectations. As previously discussed, we began using a third-party warehouse from the first
