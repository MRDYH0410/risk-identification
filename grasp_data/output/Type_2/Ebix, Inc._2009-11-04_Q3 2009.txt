MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good morning. My name is Felicia and I will be your conference operator today. At this


time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2009 Third Quarter Investor Conference Call. All lines


have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will


be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.


Mr. Raina, you may begin your conference.


Robin Raina, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you very much. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for attending Ebix 2009 third quarter


investor conference call. I have also here with me Ebix CFO, Robert Kerris.


Our Q3 2009 results were announced a few hours back. Let me summarize those results for you.


Third quarter 2009 results were yet again record results, the best ever in Ebix’s history in terms of


diluted EPS, net income and revenues. Each of the last many quarters has been a record result


with each quarter beating all the preceding quarter in our 33-year history as a company.


As a management team, we have believed in being consistent rather than just producing


spectacular quarters. You could compare these results to Q3 of 2008 or Q2 of 2009 and all


comparisons will show that the present quarter scored over all these quarters on all four key


criteria, growth and revenues, net income, diluted EPS and net margins.


Let’s delve a bit deeper into these numbers. A comparison of third quarter 2009 numbers to the


third quarter 2008 numbers reveals that all four, namely revenue, income, EBITDA, and diluted


EPS, grew in this quarter as compared to third quarter of 2008. Revenues in the third quarter of


2009 were $23.29 million as compared to 20.17 million in the third quarter of 2008, a 16% increase


– a 15.5% increase. Net income after taxes in the third quarter of 2009 was 9.43 million as


compared to 7.40 million in the third quarter of 2008, a 27% increase.


EBITDA for the current quarter was 10.73 million, a 46.7% EBITDA margin, a 20% improvement


over the 8.92 million EBITDA, a 44.1% EBITDA margin in the third quarter of 2008. The company’s


operating expenses for the quarter grew by 12% to 13.51 million as compared to 12.05 million for


the third quarter of 2008.


The results for the third quarter of 2009 were based on 12.61 million weighted average diluted


shares outstanding as compared to 12.17 million in the third quarter of 2008. Diluted EPS in the


third quarter of 2009 rose 23% to $0.76 as compared to $0.62 in the third quarter of 2008. Basic


earnings per share in the third quarter of 2009 rose 18% to $0.91 as compared to $0.77 in the third


quarter of 2008. I’m pleased that our net margins after taxes grew to 41% in the third quarter of


2009 as compared to 37% in the third quarter of 2008.


Let’s now compare these results to the second quarter 2009 results. A comparison of the third


quarter 2009 numbers to the second quarter 2009 numbers reveals that all four: namely, revenue,


income, EBITDA and diluted EPS grew in this quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2009.


Revenues grew 3.9% quarter-over-quarter, expenses grew 2.6, EBITDA grew 6.3%, operating


income grew 5.6%, net income grew 5.3%, diluted EPS increased 4.1% and basic EPS grew 3.4%.


For those of you who like to look at currency-neutral results, I have a few numbers for you.


Currency-adjusted revenues for the first nine months of 2009 grew to 69.9 million, a 28% increase


over the same period in 2008. Currency-adjusted net income after taxes in the first nine months of


2009 grew to 28.9 million, a 49% increase over the same period of 2008.

Basically, what it means is that, if you were to keep currency rates constant between the first nine


months of 2009 and the first nine months of 2008, Ebix revenues for the first nine months of 2009


would have been 3.5 million higher, and net income would have been 2.2 million higher. Currency-


adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use solely for comparing numbers from two


different periods without the impact of foreign exchange.


Currency-adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2009 grew to 23.72, a 18% increase over the


third quarter of 2008. Currency-adjusted net income after taxes in the third quarter of 2009 grew to


9.69 million, a 31.1% increase over the third quarter of 2008. Basically, what it means is that if you


were to keep currency rates constant between third quarter of 2009 and third quarter of 2008, Ebix


revenues would have been 430,000 higher and net income would have been 180,000 higher than


what have been reported.


Ebix business is broken into four main channels: the carrier channel, the exchanges, the broker


channel and the BPO channel. If you look at the performance of these channels, I have a few


numbers for you. Exchanges in this quarter were 61% of our revenues, BPO 15%, broker system


13% and carrier system 11%.


Like the second quarter of 2009, Exchanges and BPO both grew this quarter in comparison to third


quarter of 2008, while broker system and carrier system sales continued to be affected by delayed


decisions and implementations on account of carriers and brokers having to tighten their budget


and spending, and having to tighten their spending budgets on back-end systems. Exchanges


continued to grow as carriers see it as a way to increase productivity and margins. Reported broker


systems revenues derived from our foreign operations were also adversely affected by the


variances in comparative currency exchange rates. Our Exchange revenues, quarter-over-quarter


grew 19%, BPO revenues grew 95% and the broker system revenue went down 15% and the


carrier system revenue went down 11%.


Our pipeline continues to be good with many well-awaited deals having been agreed to in the last


90 days in the area of Exchanges and BPO. The economic environment continues to create


pressure on insurance companies reducing their spending. But Ebix has continued to use its cross-


selling to open up new opportunities and keep revenues growing. We believe that the squeeze in


the back-end area is temporary, and we are already starting to see some signs of recovery.


As regards our cash flows, we continue to generate strong cash flows that are bound to continue to


grow even more with the recent acquisitions. We’re also pleased to communicate that to-date, 26.6


million of the original 35 million of convertible debt issued during 2007 and 2008 to Whitebox have


been paid or converted into Ebix stock leaving our remaining balance due on those obligations of


8.4 million only.


In the last few months, Ebix has made positive strides in many areas. I will elaborate on a few of


those areas. One, new substantial EbixExchange contracts. We’ve been able to get commitments


from many large financial institutions to adopt our EbixExchange family of services. We are in


mutual non-disclosure agreement with these organizations and cannot disclose their names as yet.


But I would suffice it to say that these are very large reputed institutions, these deals are likely to


help Ebix grow organically in the year 2010 at a faster pace.


Point number two, new BPO contracts. We are a leader today in United States in the insurance


certificate issuance and tracking market. Ebix has continued to sign new deals in the BPO area that


are likely to help us keep going the organic revenue streams on the BPO channel.


Three, acquisitions, the two strategic acquisitions of Peak and EZDATA. The acquisition of Peak


and EZDATA are rather important events for Ebix. These are both very strategic acquisitions that


allow us cross-selling opportunities and also help us take a giant leap forward in terms on making


the dream of end-to-end computing possible. We intend integrating them within Ebix on a war-
