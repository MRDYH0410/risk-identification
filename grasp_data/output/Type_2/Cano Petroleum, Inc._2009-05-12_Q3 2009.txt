MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION


Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2009 Cano


Petroleum, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keisha and I would be your


operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-


and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions].


I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Cano Petroleum.


Please proceed.


Jeff Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. The third quarter for Cano


was a very good quarter for us and we were able to see responses at our Cato waterflood and


continue to see good indication of response at Cockrell Ranch. We were able to see production lift


of about 5%, more importantly oil production lift of about 8% quarter-over-quarter and were able to


see that – was able to see that without any new production wells being drilled in about six months,


at least since last October.


We continue to see our costs come down. We saw our LOE come down from about $44 a barrel to


35 and as we sit here today it’s closer to about 33. We anticipate to continue to see that reduced


cost in lease operating expenses as we see production lift. We also have seen reduction in G&A


some of which we did start to realize this quarter, some that we’ll start to realize next quarter. But


all in all, I feel like with the cost cuts that we’ve implemented, the production responses that our


operating team has seen at Cockrell – or excuse me, at Cato that we’ve had a very good quarter.


And I do want to reiterate one thing as we go forward is we’re expecting to see the same thing at


our Cockrell Ranch that we’ve seen at Cato. And Cato saw an early response for fortuitous. It had


some water that was already in the ground from a prior waterflood. We took a lot of things that we


learned at Cockrell Ranch and deployed that information and executed the plan at Cato with that


knowledge of mine. And so we do have tighter spacing, we are in an area where there has been


some water fill-up. And so as we continue to seek the Cato production lift and we expand that


waterflood, we should anticipate the same type of response out in Cockrell Ranch as we get


towards the end of this calendar year.


So, sitting in here with me, I did forget to introduce everybody. I have Ben Daitch, who is our CFO; I


also have Michael Ricketts, our Principal Accounting Officer; and then Patrick McKinney, our Senior


VP of Engineering and Operations.


So, with that I’ll hand it over Ben to go over the financials.


Ben Daitch, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Jeff. For the three months ended March 31, 2009 we incurred a net loss applicable to


common stock of $1.2 million or a loss of $0.03 per share. Last year in the third quarter we reported


net loss applicable to common stock of $1.9 million or a loss of $0.05 per share, including $0.02 per


share of income from discontinued operations.


In the third quarter our sales were 78,000 barrels of oil versus 68,000 barrels in 2008 and a 181


million cubic feet of natural gas versus 216 million cubic feet in 2008. On a BOE basis, our sales


were 108,000 BOE versus 104,000 BOE for 2008.

Third quarter production of 1,263 net BOE per day was 5% greater than the prior quarter and 7.2%


greater than last year’s third quarter.


Revenue for the third quarter was 3.9 million, down 57% compared to 9.2 million for the same


period last year. For the current quarter, including realized gains from commodity hedges we


received average prices of $62.34 per barrel and $9.64 per Mcf of natural gas or $62.50 per BOE.


The gas premium is based upon the high Btu content of our gas and the fact that we continue to


have more gas hedges in place than our current gas sales as a result of having sold our Pantwist


property last year. For the same period last year including realized gains and losses from


commodity hedges, oil prices averaged $87.33 per barrel and natural gas prices average $13.21


per Mcf, or an average price of $84.53 per BOE. You can find a table with these metrics as well as


unhedged realized prices in our Form 10-Q that was filed yesterday.


On a production basis LOE for the third quarter fell $8.36 per BOE or 19% to $35.70 per BOE from


$44.06 in the second quarter. The second quarter was down from $45.93 in the first quarter of this


fiscal year and the peak of over $56 per BOE for the month of October. We continue to realize cost


savings from actions implemented during the last two quarters with March LOE at $33.30 per BOE


on a produced barrel basis.


Our general and administrative expense was 1.2 million less then for the same quarter last year as


we’re now seeing decreased expenses pertaining to the Panhandle wildfire litigation. As a


remainder, we’ve settled all matters related to Panhandle wildfire except for one lawsuit that is


under appeal. While we continue to believe that all the wildfire lawsuits were without merit; we’ll


continue to seek the most economic route to finalizing this matter.


These G&A decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to payroll and benefits.


We anticipate additional savings in the coming quarters as we reduced our home office staff by


25% during our third quarter. Annualized savings from this reduction should exceed $750,000 per


year. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased $300,000 as a function of lower revenues, which


is partially offset by higher ad valorem tax rates.


Depletion and depreciation expense increased for the yearly quarter-over-quarter period from 1


million or $8.03 per BOE to 1.6 million or $12.35 per BOE. The increased rates were primarily due


to higher PPE from capital invested over the year.


Net interest expense was $165,000 for the quarter. This figure was reduced by approximately


$300,000 as we capitalized interest related to our waterflood and ASP projects.


We recorded preferred stock dividends of $477,000 for the quarter ended March 31, versus


$877,000 for the prior year. This reduction was due to the retirement of 22.9 million of notional


value of our preferred stock during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. In the current quarter,


59% of our preferred stock dividends were payment in kind with the balance paid in cash.


That’s it for earnings. Now onto our capital expenditures/liquidity update. As a function of earlier


than anticipated increased fluid production at our Cato and Panhandle Properties, we’ve increased


our current year development capital expenditure budget from 38.5 million to $49.8 million. Details


of how this capital is being deployed, and what we expect to achieve through these expenditures


will be discussed by Pat McKinney.


The initial and current borrowing base under our revolver is $60 million. The borrowing base is due


to be redetermined based upon the value of our proven reserves at May 1, and again at June 30.


We will be beginning the reserve review process this week.
